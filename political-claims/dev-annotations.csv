Voting fraud in general is considered to be rare, although voting experts agree that the risks are greater for mail balloting than for in-person voting. Still, Trump didn’t produce any evidence for the ""thousands and thousands"" claim, and voting experts said his assertion doesn’t square with what is known about the actual cases of voting fraud in the recent past.

DeSantis provided no details in his speech, but he was referring to his effort in January to get Trump to extend the amount of time the federal government would pick up the tab for debris removal and emergency protective measures from five to 45 days. DeSantis got a verbal commitment from Trump to make that happen, but we were unable to confirm that with FEMA.
A spokeswoman for DeSantis says the ""historic commitment"" is that such an extension is unusual for Florida. But we found that it’s not unusual for the president to tack on extensions even for months that the federal government will pick up the entire tab.

""Illegal"" is probably the wrong word. There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web.

The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do. The end result is similar to full prohibition: Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world.
The U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet.

In 2020, at the end of the Trump administration, the publicly held debt did exceed 100% of GDP for the first time since World War II. It’s down since then.
A broader measure, the gross federal debt, which includes funds lent from one part of the government to another, has been above 100% of GDP since 2012, well before Biden became president.
Changes in federal debt levels are largely driven by mandatory spending beyond the direct control of any president, and much of the rest has been initiated by lawmakers and presidents from both parties. The debt-to-GDP ratio surged in 2020 because of the federal response to the pandemic and the economic contraction.

A couple of other polls we found had Ohio GOP support slightly less at 75 percent.
The part of his statement about the 58 percent approval overall refers to an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll. It showed 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president.

He could have meant that Americans who commit voter fraud should lose their citizenship, though it’s unclear where they would be sent should they be deported.
And because he espouses his idea in a column about illegal immigration, he could have meant what the Facebook post says: That undocumented immigrants who commit voter fraud should lose their citizenship (though they wouldn’t have citizenship if they were undocumented immigrants).

Murphy is pushing Rubio's position too far when he says Rubio opposes immigration reform.

He still wants to change immigration laws, but he believes it is politically impractical to do it in one swoop.
Some immigration advocates argue that Rubio’s piecemeal approach is a delay tactic and kicks a path to citizenship even further down the road.
Rubio does support Trump, who has said he will overturn a program that temporarily allows Dreamers to avoid deportation, affecting about 740,000 people. That action by itself would leave those undocumented immigrants to face the threat of deportation. Rubio has said he supports a legislative replacement for DACA.

While rural tribal residents in North Dakota are issued PO Boxes for addresses, it is not true that all tribal residents only have PO Boxes.

North Dakota’s law does pose obstacles for many tribal citizens who don’t have street addresses. However, through the work of voter rights advocates and officials with the Secretary of State’s office, there are ways that Native American voters who have PO boxes instead of residential street addresses will be able to vote.

Or a year. It takes more time than that.""
Edming leaned on criticism of a medical treatment — not a vaccine — developed in the 1930s and released without a fraction of the scientific scrutiny given to the COVID-19 vaccines.
And in any case, his conclusion is contrary to the overwhelming medical consensus and what we can clearly see from the worldwide rollout. Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (with others on the way) were able to develop as quickly as they did due to a breakthrough vaccine mechanism, billions in federal funding and an array of bureaucratic fast-tracking that allowed faster production, simultaneous trials and timely approvals.
Those vaccines were together tested on more than 100,000 people. And with millions of people now safely and effectively vaccinated, we see that safety claims made based on the trials were indeed valid. Which makes Edming’s claim ridiculous.

"""In 1992, the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing.""","Gaetz said, ""In 1992 the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing.""
He got the year wrong; he was was actually referring to the 1996 platform. That document touted Clinton’s efforts on stopping illegal immigration. Using similar words as what Gaetz described, it said that in 1992, ""Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again.""
Gaetz accurately captured the party’s sentiment in the mid 1990s. More recent platforms have favored a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
