Still, Trump didn\u2019t produce any evidence for the \"thousands and thousands\" claim, and voting experts said his assertion doesn\u2019t square with what is known about the actual cases of voting fraud in the recent past.\nWe rate the statement False.","full_article":"The daily White House briefings about coronavirus sometimes veer into adjacent topics, and since Wisconsin voted on April 7, one of those topics has been voting by mail.\nDespite late pleas by Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to make the election mail balloting only, the state\u2019s Republican Legislature, backed by a Republican-majority state Supreme Court, opposed Evers\u2019 plan. In person voting was held amid social distancing, though with significantly fewer polling places.\nAt briefings on April 7 and 8, President Donald Trump was asked about an expanded role for mail balloting at a time of a global pandemic. He responded by criticizing mail balloting as illegitimate and subject to widespread fraud (even though he had recently voted by mail for a Florida election).\nOn April 7, Trump said, \"Now, mail ballots \u2014 they cheat. Okay? People cheat. Mail ballots are a very dangerous thing for this country, because they're cheaters. They go and collect them.\u00a0 They're fraudulent in many cases.\"\nWhen pressed, Trump went on to call mail-in voting \"horrible\" and \"corrupt\" and alleged that \"you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody\u2019s living room, signing ballots all over the place.\"\nAt the following day\u2019s briefing, a reporter asked Trump for evidence to support the \"thousands and thousands\" characterization.\nTrump responded, \"I think there's a lot of evidence, but we'll provide you with some, okay?\" (The White House did not provide PolitiFact with additional evidence.)\nTrump did cite a lawsuit by the conservative group Judicial Watch against the state of California, saying that \"a million people should not have been voting\" in the state. However, PolitiFact California previously rated a similar assertion by the president Pants on Fire, because the legal settlement in question required Los Angeles County to begin removing inactive voter registrations; it said nothing about voter fraud or people illegally voting.\nIn recent years, Trump has repeatedly claimed the existence of massive voter fraud and election rigging, which we\u2019ve debunked again and again and again and again and again and again and again.\nIn his most recent comments, we found no support for the notion that \"you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.\"\nWe did find that mail balloting does pose a potentially higher risk for fraud than in-person voting does. However, experts said the reality is much more nuanced than Trump let on.\n\"I can\u2019t imagine any living room with thousands of people in it,\" said Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who specializes in election law. But even to the extent he\u2019s saying that vote-by-mail efforts are rife with fraud, \"that is false,\" Hasen said.\n\"There are more cases of absentee ballot fraud than other kinds of election crimes,\" he said. \"But the risk is relatively low, and the benefits, especially during the time of a pandemic, are quite great.\"\nA lack of evidence of voter fraud\nVoting and election specialists said there\u2019s no evidence that \"thousands and thousands\" of Americans are collaborating on mail-ballot fraud, whether they\u2019re sitting in one living room or not.\n\"There is no evidence that any candidate or group has executed a mail ballot fraud scheme of this magnitude in modern elections,\" said Michael P. McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist. \"In this day of social media, it is nearly impossible to keep anything secret, much less a scheme involving thousands of people.\"\nIf this was happening, McDonald said, voters would wonder where their ballots were. \"They would show up to vote and be told by election officials that they had already voted,\" he said. \"Election officials would see patterns in where mail ballots were being sent, the addresses they were being returned from, and the signatures on the ballot return envelope. If a mail ballot fraud scheme happened on the alleged scale, someone, somewhere, would notice.\"\nMore broadly, repeated efforts to uncover widespread voter fraud have produced little.\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a panel to investigate voter fraud, was shuttered before it found significant patterns of fraud.\n\u2022 News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.\n\u2022 In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s administration tried to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives \u2014 including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the voter rolls.\n\u2022 The five states that hold all-mail elections (Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington) have reported little fraud. \"There\u2019s just very little evidence that there is more than a handful of fraudulent (vote-by-mail) cases across the country in a given election cycle,\" Judd Choate, the director of elections in the Colorado Department of State, told the New York Times.\nRichard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News and a frequent election volunteer in San Francisco, said ballot security measures in his state offer protections.\n\"We have a list of all the registered voters in our precinct,\" Winger said. \"The list indicates which voters have received a ballot in the postal mail. In every election, voters wander in and want to vote there, but we say, \u2018It says here you already got a mail ballot.\u2019 And they say, \u2018Oh, yes, it's at home\u2019 or, \u2018I never received a ballot\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, I lost it.\u2019 And we explain that every ballot must be accounted for. They can vote provisionally at the polls, but the vote will only be counted once it is clear their original ballot didn't get submitted for counting.\"\nSteve Schale, a longtime Democratic consultant in Florida, said his state has improved its mail-ballot procedures in recent years.\n\"I think the controls that are in place today really limit the opportunities for fraud,\" Schale said. \"Back in the day, there was more ability for operatives to actually put their hands on ballots, such as collecting them and turning them in. Operatives on both sides will always push up to the legal line when it comes to all aspects of campaigns, but again, the laws now are so clear that one has to go out of their way to break the law.\"\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a coronavirus briefing on April 7, 2020. (AP)\nVerified examples of mail-ballot fraud\nRare doesn\u2019t mean nonexistent. And experts agree that mail balloting does provide a greater potential for ballot fraud than in-person voting does.\n\"It's definitely easier to have fraud with absentee voting than in-person voting, and some cases of it have had a big impact,\" said Rob Richie, president of FairVote, a voting-access advocacy group.\nA congressional election was overturned in North Carolina in 2018 after evidence surfaced that the Republican candidate benefited from an effort to collect absentee ballots from voters. In South Florida alone, the Miami Herald cited examples of ballot fraud in Hialeah (1994, 2011, and 2012), Homestead (2014), and Miami and Miami-Dade County (1998, 2008, 2013).\n\"All this must be kept in perspective, and there are ways states seek to counter it, but it's not outlandish to say fraud is more likely with absentee voting than in-person voting,\" Richie said.\nLonna Atkeson, University of New Mexico political scientist, told NPR\u00a0 that \"where there is fraud in the system, it really seems to be in mail balloting. There's some, there's not a lot. I think there's a little bit.\"\nOther drawbacks with voting by mail\nWhile voting by mail might be necessary in an extended battle with coronavirus, voting experts acknowledge that it\u2019s not a perfect solution.\n\u2022 There could be an increase in voter errors made at home, since election officials won\u2019t be standing nearby to help. This means more ballots could be rejected and not counted.\n\u2022 Voter education will be needed for people who are unaccustomed to absentee voting. Voters will need reminders to sign their ballots, and elections officials will need to increase public outreach to dispel myths about absentee ballots, such as the one that those ballots aren\u2019t counted unless an election is close.\n\u2022 Some groups have less convenient access to mail than others do, such as residents of Native American reservations. Mail voting also poses challenges for voters who move frequently, or who have language or literacy issues. And some disabled voters, including those who are blind, cannot effectively cast mail ballots without assistance.\n\u2022 Voting at home could lead to coercion by abusive spouses or other relatives.","cleaned_claim":"With voting by mail, you get thousands and thousands of people sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.","ambiguity_score":0.8470813632,"paraphrases":[["With voting by mail, people can fill out ballots in their homes rather than going to a polling place.",0.8470813632],["If people are allowed to vote by mail, then thousands of people could end up sitting in somebody's living room, signing ballots all over the place.",0.0366369933],["By voting by mail, people can vote from the comfort of their own homes, without having to go to a polling station.

DeSantis got a verbal commitment from Trump to make that happen, but we were unable to confirm that with FEMA.\nA spokeswoman for DeSantis says the \"historic commitment\" is that such an extension is unusual for Florida. But we found that it\u2019s not unusual for the president to tack on extensions even for months that the federal government will pick up the entire tab.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nThis fact-check was updated not long after publication with official comment from FEMA.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/125fd840-1bff-4f8e-871f-da10d3146307","full_article":"Editor\u2019s note, March 10\u00a012:55 p.m.: Two days after our fact-check posted, the White House issued a press release stating President Donald Trump on March 10 ordered that the federal government will cover 100 percent of eligible costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for 45 days from Hurricane Michael\u2019s landfall. It does not affect our ruling.\nIn his campaign for governor, Ron DeSantis promised Florida voters that his personal relationship with President Donald Trump would pay off for the state.\nA little more than two months since taking office, DeSantis claims it already has.\nDeSantis used part of his first State of the State speech March 5 to trumpet news of a \"historic commitment\" from the Trump administration to help repair parts of the Panhandle that Hurricane Michael battered in October.\n\"I\u2019ve already traveled to Washington, D.C., and secured a historic commitment from the Trump administration to provide assistance to the communities that Michael battered,\" DeSantis said.\nIs that true?\nPart of the answer, PolitiFact Florida found, relies on a handshake agreement between the governor and president. The other part about it being it \"historic\" is more easily understood, and wrong.\nDeSantis met with Trump\nAfter Michael barreled through the areas around Mexico Beach, federal emergency management officials said the federal government would pay 100 percent of the costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for a period five days. After that, the federal government would cover 75 percent of the costs. DeSantis asked Trump to extend 100 percent federal coverage for 45 days.\n\"Debris remains pervasive, and thousands of businesses are still struggling to reopen,\" DeSantis wrote to Trump, saying the state had already spent $1 billion.\nDeSantis met with Trump at the White House in January and said Trump granted his request.\nThe agreement between Trump and DeSantis remains a verbal one, however. DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre told PolitiFact Florida the state does not have written confirmation, and FEMA media relations headquarters did not respond to our requests for days.\nShortly after our fact-check initially posted, a FEMA spokeswoman told us that the agency was aware of the announcement by DeSantis regarding the increase in the federal cost share and that the request was in process. She did not elaborate.\nLocal governments we talked to are proceeding as if the deal is done.\nBay County, for example, submitted for reimbursement March 8. County spokeswoman Valerie Sale said she expects the project will be covered at the current federal share of 75 percent and will be adjusted on subsequent projects if or when the federal share is modified.\nAccording to Sale, her county heard from a FEMA official, Nelson Santos, who said FEMA was working on codifying the change into the Federal Register. We reached Santos by email to confirm.\n\"The only confirmation I made clear to Bay County consultants is the 5-days to 45-days extension,\" Santos, a FEMA program delivery manager, told PolitiFact in an email. \"It has not been determined or official as of yet what the cost share will be.\"\nThe best answer we could get from FEMA by deadline was that DeSantis\u2019 request remains in process and has not yet been determined.\nThe extension would be a \"game changer,\" Bay County Commission Chairman Philip \"Griff\" Griffitts told PolitiFact, saving county taxpayers there an estimated $85 million.\nTanya Castro, administrator of hard-hit Mexico Beach, said that her city was advised verbally by state and FEMA officials that it will receive the full amount of its reimbursement, but she didn\u2019t have any formal documentation.\nMexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey praised efforts by DeSantis to help his coastal community including $2.8 million in state money for debris cleanup. So far, FEMA provided about $2 million for cleanup. But Cathey said his city needs more money.\n\"We need it fast,\" he said.\n\u2018Historic\u2019? Not really\nAssuming the extension will occur, it\u2019s not as historic as DeSantis let on.\nIn 2017, Trump authorized 100 percent coverage for Puerto Rico for 180 days following Hurricane Maria. He later extended the amount of time to 90 days for debris and 60 days for emergency protective measures.\nHe also authorized 100 percent coverage for the Virgin Islands for emergency protective measures for 30 days following Hurricane Irma. Trump then extended his order for 60 days, both for debris removal and emergency protective measures in response to hurricanes Maria and Irma.\nTrump was not the first president to do this. President George W. Bush gave the go-ahead for extensions that provided 100 percent coverage for months in Louisiana and Mississippi.\nSteve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the federal Stafford Act allows the president to reduce or eliminate the share of cost borne by local or state entities, Ellis said.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t call that historic,\" Ellis said.\u00a0\"It has been done before.\"\nWhen we told DeSantis\u2019 office about we learned, she clarified that this was the first time in Florida history that a newly elected governor received the president\u2019s commitment to increase the 100 percent coverage from five to 45 days.\n\"We are not aware of any time in Florida history where a hurricane received this many days at 100 percent reimbursement other than the three storms in 2005, which were considered as a group,\" Ferre said. \"This is a historic extension for Florida. Gov. DeSantis has the commitment from the president of the United States, who is the only one who can authorize it.\"\nMeanwhile, some federal lawmakers have expressed frustration that despite efforts by both chambers, the budget deal Trump signed in February to end the shutdown included no disaster relief.\n\"Florida\u2019s Panhandle needs help now, not six months down the road,\" said U.S. Rep.

By email, Espinosa pointed us to a November 2012 paper, \"Grocery Bag Bans and Foodborne Illness,\" by Jonathan Klick and Joshua Wright, law professors at the University of Pennsylvania and George Mason University, respectively.\nIn their write-up, posted by a University of Pennsylvania research center, the authors noted that San Francisco County barred large supermarkets and pharmacies from using \"non-compostable plastic checkout bags,\" effective Oct. 20, 2007. In 2012, the county\u2019s board of supervisors \"expanded the non-compostable plastic checkout bag ban to cover all retail and food establishments in\" the county, effective Oct. 1, 2012, the paper says, also requiring stores to charge at least a dime for any bag provided.\n\"To analyze emergency room visits,\" the authors wrote, \"we used the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development\u2019s Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Data for each quarter from 2005-2010. These data provide the county of residence of each person admitted to a California ER, as well as the principal diagnosis for the individual using ICD-9 codes. Given the prevalence of coliform bacteria, especially E. coli, in reusable grocery bags, we focus on ER visits involving E. coli,\" the two said.\nAnd? The San Francisco bag ban is \"associated with a statistically significant and particularly large increase in ER visits for E. Coli infections. We find increases between one fourth and two thirds, suggesting an increase in visits between 72 and 191 annually,\" the paper said.\nAll told, the authors said, the bag ban there is \"associated with a 46 percent increase in deaths from foodborne illnesses. This implies an increase of 5.5 annual deaths for the county.\" On the other hand, the study\u2019s small sample size make \"any inferential claims\" tentative, the authors wrote.\nWe emailed and telephoned each professor and didn\u2019t hear back.\nSan Francisco County memo\nHunting perspective, we then ran the authors\u2019 names through the Nexis news database. That query led us to a March 2013 story posted by Texas-based D Magazine stating a San Francisco health officer had spelled out flaws in the professors\u2019 paper.\nThat story included a web link to a Feb. 8, 2013, memo from a San Francisco County health officer, Tom\u00e1s Aragon, to Eileen Shields, a county public health information officer. The memo said the county Department of Public Health had reviewed the professors\u2019 paper which, the officer noted, \"has not been submitted for rigorous scientific peer review and publication.\"\nGenerally, the memo states, \"Klick & Wright\u2019s conclusion that San Francisco\u2019s policy of banning of plastic bags has caused a significant increase in gastrointestinal bacterial infections and a \u201846 percent increase in the deaths from foodborne illnesses\u2019 is not warranted.\"\nOne weakness, the memo says, was that the professors presumed a link between reusable bags and a seeming spike in gastrointestinal bacterial infections--yet they failed to establish the link. \"Drawing causal conclusions from this type of study is called an \u2018ecological fallacy,\u2019\" the memo states. \"The basic study flaw is that persons that use reusable bags frequently may not be the same persons that were diagnosed with gastrointestinal bacterial infections in their study. This is the reason epidemiologists will not use ecological studies to test causal hypotheses. At best, ecologic studies raise epidemiologic causal hypotheses but cannot test them.\"\nThe memo continues: \"In testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to measure the outcome (gastrointestinal infections) and exposure to the putative cause (reusable bags) in the same persons. Because of their study design, this was not possible.\"\nAlso, the memo says that in \"testing causal hypotheses, it is necessary to \u2018control for\u2019 alternative causal explanations (called \u2018confounders\u2019). Because of their study design, this was not possible. For example, gastrointestinal bacterial infections are not only caused from contaminated food, but also from contaminated water, improper food handling or preparation, or from person-to-person spread (such as sexual activity, especially in men who have sex with men). In any causal study, investigators always adjust for the \u2018usual suspects,\u2019\" the memo says.\nMoreover, the memo notes that the study\u2019s focus on illnesses identified in emergency rooms misses that people seek care at other places--or not at all--leaving the data incomplete. Alternatively, the memo says, laboratory-confirmed diagnoses reported to the health department are \"the proper basis for surveillance of microbiological data on these infections in our population.\"\nThe official went on to say there had been increases in some illnesses oft linked to food. Specifically, according to the memo, health department data show an increase in campylobacteriosis, one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness. Then again, the memo says, there was no detected increase in salmonellosis or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which is transmitted by food or water contaminated with animal or human feces.\n\"Interpreting these changes is not straightforward,\" the memo continues. \"The epidemiology of enteric pathogens in San Francisco differs compared to surrounding counties because we are an urban center with a larger population of ethnic immigrants and men who have sex with men (MSM),\" the memo states. \"Research studies need to adjust for these population differences.\"\nThe memo also disputes the professors\u2019 conclusions about deaths going up after the bag ban, mostly by declaring that 111 of the 140 San Francisco deaths from 2001 through 2010 figuring into the paper were attributed to Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile--an intestinal infection most commonly tied to exposure to antibiotics, particularly among hospitalized patients. \"Foodborne exposures is not yet an established cause of C. difficile enterocolitis, but is an active area of research,\" the memo says, going on to say the authors shouldn\u2019t have included C. difficile deaths in their analysis.\nSumming up, the memo says \"the idea that widespread use of reusable bags may cause gastrointestinal infections if they are not regularly cleaned is plausible. However, the hypothesis that there is a significant increase in gastrointestinal foodborne illnesses and deaths due to reusable bags has not been tested, much less demonstrated in this study. It would be a disservice to San Francisco residents and visitors to alarm them by claiming that it has been. It could be useful, however, to remind people to use safe food-handling practices, including maintaining the cleanliness of everything they use to transport, handle, and prepare food.\"\nWe asked San Francisco County if there had been any response by the professors to the county\u2019s memo. Nancy Sarieh of the public health department told us by email: \"They did respond. We agreed to disagree and they have not updated their paper.\"\nIn February 2013, we otherwise noticed, commentator Debra J. Saunders of the\u00a0San Francisco Chronicle quoted Klick saying he cannot \"rule out the possibility that there was something peculiar that happened in San Francisco.\"\nA Texas expert\nSeparately, we asked Dr. Philip Huang, the medical director for the Austin\/Travis County Health and Human Services Department, to take a look at the paper posted by Penn plus the San Francisco County memo.\nHuang said by phone that the Penn paper, limited to ER admissions, missed the fact that individuals who take sick from food are treated by private doctors or don\u2019t even seek health care. Notably too, Huang said, the researchers failed to consider the health surveillance data later cited by the county.\n\"I mean, who knows? You can get a spike\" in illness \"and there could have been something else going on in the community that is totally unrelated,\" Huang said. \"I think the people who are closest to the data in their own community would have the best perspective.\" From ER admissions alone, Huang said, \"certainly the data is not there to make any conclusions about this.\"\nFoundation notes other accounts\nNext, we circled back to Espinosa, the foundation spokeswoman, about the memo disputing the professors\u2019 analysis and Huang\u2019s comments. By email, Espinosa pointed out a 2011 peer-reviewed study, partly supported by the American Chemistry Council, finding that among reusable bags randomly collected from consumers entering grocery stores in the San Francisco area, Los Angeles and Tucson, E. coli were identified in 8 percent of bags plus a \"wide range of enteric bacteria,\" according to the authors including Charles P. Gerba of the University of Arizona.\n\"When meat juices were added to bags and stored in the trunks of cars for two hours, the number of bacteria increased 10-fold, indicating the potential for bacterial growth in the bags,\" the authors wrote. \"Hand or machine washing was found to reduce the bacteria in bags by > 99.9%. These results indicate that reusable bags, if not properly washed on a regular basis, can play a role in the cross-contamination of foods. \"\nEspinosa also noted a May 2012 Los Angeles Times news story describing an Oregon outbreak affecting nine soccer players who had come in contact with a reused grocery bag. The story said one of the girls got sick shortly after arrival, from a norovirus she presumably acquired prior to the trip, Dr. Kimberly K. Repp of the Oregon Health and Science University and Dr. William E. Keene of the Oregon Public Health Division reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\"The sick girl was then isolated in the room of one of the chaperones,\" the Times reported. \"Nonetheless, eight other girls became ill. The investigation showed that the virus was found on a reusable grocery bag that had been used to store snacks for the team. It had, unfortunately, been stored in the bathroom,\" the story said. When the sick girl used the bathroom, the norovirus was aerosolized and deposited on the bag, where it was later transferred to other girls when they got snacks.","cleaned_claim":"When San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, you saw the number of instances of people going to the ER with things like salmonella and other related illnesses spike.","ambiguity_score":0.0181979164,"paraphrases":[["The number of people going to the ER with food poisoning and other related illnesses spiked after San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags.",0.0120712193],["San Francisco's ban on plastic grocery bags led to an increase in the number of people going to the ER with illnesses like salmonella.",0.0181979164],["When San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, the number of people going to the ER with foodborne illnesses like salmonella increased.",0.0126787378],["When San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, the number of people going to the ER with illnesses like salmonella increased.",0.0117771327],["When San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags, there was an increase in the number of people going to the ER with illnesses like salmonella.",0.0116483821]]}

Both forms of water torture -- and the risks -- are similar and the Senate report from 1903 makes it clear that military prosecutors regarded the \"water cure\" as a form of torture.\nWe rate  the claim asTrue.\n(If you have a claim you\u2019d likePolitiFact Rhode Islandto check, email us at[email protected]And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)","full_article":"The so-called \"CIA torture report\" has heightened debate over whether certain interrogation techniques used by the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks constituted torture.\nRhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse weighed in on Dec. 14 when he appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" with host Chris Wallace and political consultant Karl Rove.\nIn the portion of the program that dealt with whether waterboarding, which simulates the feeling of drowning, constitutes torture, Whitehouse said there was precedent in the United States to conclude that it was.\n\"We decided that waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution,\" Whitehouse said.\n\"We decided waterboarding was torture when we prosecuted Japanese soldiers as war criminals for waterboarding Americans during World War II, and we decided waterboarding was torture when the American court system described waterboarding as torture when Ronald Reagan and his Department of Justice prosecuted a Texas sheriff and several of his associates for waterboarding detainees.\"\nBecause the Philippine revolution, which dates back to the 1890s, is the earliest reference Whitehouse made, we decided to check out that part of his statement.\nWhile we were waiting for Whitehouse's office to respond to our request for documentation, we started poking around ourselves.\nThere's little doubt that what is now called waterboarding -- then known as water torture or by the odd name of the \"water cure\" -- was used by Americans in the Philippines after the U.S. gained colonial authority over the islands from the Spanish in 1898 under the terms of the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War.\nFilipinos had been recruited to help fight the Spanish but when the Spanish were vanquished, the Filipinos tried to gain their independence. The resulting guerilla war had some things in common with the U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, complete with boobytraps, suspicions that all Filipinos were guerrilla fighters, and the depiction of the guerillas as treacherous fanatics.\nMost accounts we found report that an infantry captain named Edwin F. Glenn was found guilty of engaging in water torture during the war.\nGlenn was a judge advocate at the time he was involved in waterboarding. By the time he was court-martialed, he had been promoted to major. He was specifically charged with administering the \"water cure\" to a prominent Philippine resident named Tobeniano Ealdama, whom he suspected of collaborating with insurgents.\nWhitehouse's office cited a detailed 1903 Senate report on courts-martial in the Philippines. The section on Glenn accuses him of carrying out \"a method of punishment commonly known in the Philippine Islands as the 'water cure;' that is, did cause water to be introduced into the mouth and stomach of the said Ealdama against his will\" around Nov. 27, 1900.\nGlenn admitted to the practice but defended it, arguing -- as waterboarding supporters do today -- that it saved lives. A military court didn't think that was sufficient justification. He was found guilty. But his sentence was light -- a one-month suspension and a $50 fine, which was the equivalent to more than $1,200 today.\nGlenn wasn't the only soldier to be court-martialed for administering the \"water cure,\" and testimony in the Senate report makes it clear that this was frequently used to extract information.\nFirst Lt. Julien E. Gaujot, of the 10th U.S. Cavalry, was found guilty of doing it to three priests in January, 1902. He was suspended from command for three months, forfeiting $50 in pay per month for that period.\nThe military court made it clear that, in the cases of both men, the court was being lenient.\nLike Glenn, Gaujot admitted using water torture, saying he did it because he knew the priests were insurgents and \"I knew that they possessed information that would be valuable to the American cause.\"\n\"It was impossible to obtain reliable information regarding the insurgents from the inhabitants, who are, as a whole, crafty, lying, and treacherous, many of them being fanatical savages who respect no laws and whose every instinct is depraved,\" Glenn told the court.\nNot all of the courts-martial were successful.\nFor example, 1st Lt. Edwin A. Hickman of the First U.S. Cavalry was brought up on charges for ordering that two Filipinos be held upside down and the upper half of their bodies dunked in an open spring to extract information and to get the men to act as guides. He admitted doing it but argued that it wasn't unlawful.\nThe court acquitted Hickman because of \"the abnormal and disgraceful methods of armed resistance to the authority of the United States; the treachery of the natives generally; the paramount necessity of obtaining information, and the belief on the part of the accused that the punishment administered was within the rules of war and under the instructions of superior military authority.\"\nIn these cases, Judge Advocate General George B. Davis said General Order #100, which dated back to 1863, \"contains the requirement that military necessity does not admit of cruelty -- that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge -- nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions.\" In these cases, there was no emergency that required torture, Davis argued.\nOne might debate whether the \"water cure\" is the same as waterboarding. In both cases, the victim is lying down and restrained. With waterboarding, the face is sometimes covered by a towel with the body tilted to try to keep water in the upper airways and out of the lungs.\nWith the water cure, water went directly into the mouth and was forced into the stomach, causing a great deal of pain. In both instances, the goal is not to drown the victim, but to make things as unpleasant as possible. Both produce the sensation of being unable to breathe.\nEven if the water doesn't get into the lungs directly, the victim may vomit and inhale the vomit, which can be fatal.\nThe water cure was clearly effective in inducing fear. According to accounts in the Senate report, just the threat of repeating \"the water cure\" could be enough to break the will of recalcitrant Filipinos.\n\"At a minimum, the techniques are substantially similar,\" said Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson.","cleaned_claim":"The United States decided waterboarding was torture back when we court-martialed American soldiers for waterboarding Philippine insurgents in the Philippine revolution.","ambiguity_score":0.3845601976,"paraphrases":[["The United States decided that waterboarding was torture during the Philippine revolution, when American soldiers were court-martialed for waterboarding Philippine insurgents.",0.0386029109],["The United States has historically considered waterboarding to be a form of torture, as evidenced by the court-martialing of American soldiers who used this method on Philippine insurgents during the Philippine Revolution.",0.2458498627],["The United States has considered waterboarding to be a form of torture since the 1800s, when American soldiers were court-martialed for using the technique on Philippine insurgents.",0.3845601976],["The United States has long considered waterboarding to be a form of torture, dating back to when American soldiers were court-martialed for using the technique on Philippine insurgents during the Philippine revolution.",0.1306126863]]}

The group, whose members include Common Cause Wisconsin and an affiliate of One Wisconsin Now, says its priorities include seeking changes in voting rights by the year 2020.\nThe early voting at issue here is more formally known as in-person absentee voting -- that is, casting a ballot in person before election day.\nIn July 2016, in a\u00a0lawsuit involving One Wisconsin Now, a federal judge struck down limits on early voting\u00a0that were approved by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers. As a result, cities were allowed to offer early voting in more locations, not just at City Hall. Milwaukee and Madison added satellite locations, but so far, Green Bay and most other communities in Wisconsin have not.\n(On election day, you must vote at the designated polling place near your home. But early in-person voting can be done at any location in your city that offers it.)\nThe Green Bay situation\nThe email featured in The Nation\u2019s article, as well as related emails, were provided to the magazine by the One Wisconsin Now affiliate, which the article said obtained the emails through a public records request. The liberal advocacy group later provided the emails to us.\nThey show that on Aug. 23, 2016, in the weeks after the court ruling, state Rep. Eric Genrich, D-Green Bay, began asking Green Bay City Clerk Kris Teske what her plan was regarding Green Bay offering early voting.\nHe said he would like to see the city offer multiple satellite locations; UW-Green Bay was not mentioned. Teske said in her first reply: \"I\u2019m very reluctant to have a satellite location for (ballot) security purposes and it is not budgeted for.\"\nTwo days later, more emails were exchanged. Teske told Genrich the city would offer early voting at her office, leading Genrich to ask her again about multiple satellite locations.\nTeske replied: \"I don\u2019t know what else there is to discuss,\" she began, reiterating that she lacks staff and money for satellite voting, and adding: \"There is no reason why anyone can\u2019t either vote in our office, ask for an absentee ballot to be mailed to them, or vote on election day.\"\nGenrich persisted, asking for a meeting with Teske, and he evidently somehow conveyed to Teske that he wanted satellite voting at UW-Green Bay. (Long lines at the UW-Green Bay polling site for Wisconsin\u2019s April 2016 primary election were cited as one reason for opening an early voting site on the campus.)\nTeske's reply, in the\u00a0email featured in The Nation article, was sent the next day, Aug. 26, 2016, to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission. It read:\nI have a state representative who is being very persistent about having an alternate polling location at UWGB. I don\u2019t like the idea at all for many reasons: Staffing, ballot security, budget, etc. He is on the ballot for 25 of our wards.\nI was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on election day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the Democrats and he is a Democrat. I have spoken with our (mayoral) chief of staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn't going to happen.\nA response came two weeks later, on Sept. 9, 2016, from Nathan Judnic, legal counsel for the Wisconsin Election Commission. He wrote that budget and ballot-security concerns are legitimate reasons for not offering satellite locations. But he also told Teske that if the UW-Green Bay polling site \"is OK for election day, and there is no political advantage then, I\u2019m not sure what the difference is for in-person absentee voting at that same location.\"\nTeske, in turn, told Judnic that if she could open a satellite location, it would not be at UW-Green Bay because the campus is difficult to navigate and therefore students would likely be the only early voters in the city using it.\nA final note on the partisanship part of the claim regarding Teske:\nTeske does not show up in a database of donor to state political candidates. She was appointed city clerk by Green Bay Mayor James Schmitt.

We know from New York City arrest data that there are cases where this is the top charge at the time of arrest. In cases where the judge deems a defendant to be a flight risk, some pretrial supervision outside of a jail can be imposed. If a defendant is charged with this and certain other, more serious child pornography charges, bail may be imposed.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.","full_article":"Changes in New York\u2019s bail laws have been hailed by some nonprofit criminal justice organizations as a way to reduce inequities and mass incarceration. The changes will allow people who have been charged with certain crimes to stay out of jail while waiting for their trials without having to come up with money to post bail. But some in law enforcement are critical of the changes, which eliminate money bail for offenses that account for approximately 90 percent of arrests statewide.\nThe union that represents active and retired police officers in New York City made a claim about the new law, which takes effect Jan. 1. In a Twitter post, the New York City Police Benevolent Association said, \"Defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free.\"\nAs evidence for its claim, the police union included in its tweet a section of state law regarding child pornography. The union cited section 263.10 of the penal code, which states: \"A person is\u00a0 guilty of promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child when, knowing the character and\u00a0 content thereof, he produces, directs or promotes any obscene performance which includes sexual conduct by a child less than seventeen years of age. Promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child is a class D felony.\"\nWe\u2019ve heard many claims about what the new law will do, and we wondered if the police union\u2019s claim is accurate.\nThe law\u2019s details\nThe new law has a list of \"qualifying\" offenses for which a judge can set bail. These qualifying offenses are serious crimes, and some involve child pornography.\u00a0Judges are permitted to impose bail under the new law for these offenses: facilitating a sexual performance by a child with a controlled substance or alcohol, use of a child in a sexual performance, or luring a child for the purpose of committing a crime against him or her. On April 1, 2019, when the new law was passed, three people with these qualifying offenses were in jail awaiting trial in New York City, according to a report from the Center for Court Innovation, which advocates for alternatives to incarceration.\nBut not every child pornography charge described in the statute is a qualifying offense.\nA person charged with the offense cited by the union -- \"producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child\" -- would have to be released and bail would not be imposed.\nNew York\u2019s pretrial law - the current one and the one that takes effect Jan. 1 - does not allow judges to evaluate whether a person is dangerous to the community when deciding whether that person should be held before trial. Unlike in other states, judges can only consider whether a\u00a0 defendant is likely to return to court. In cases where a judge\u00a0has doubts about whether the defendant is likely to return, the judge would have to\u00a0\"release the principal\" and select a non-monetary option, such as pretrial supervision\u00a0or travel restrictions, and choose the least restrictive option \"that will reasonably assure the principal\u2019s return to court,\" according to the law.\nWhat experts say\nWe spoke with legal experts, some who specialize in prosecution and others in criminal defense. Many agreed with the police union's tweet.\nBut several pointed to what they call a more realistic legal scenario.\nTaryn Merkl, a former federal prosecutor who led a human trafficking task force in Brooklyn, said that it is hard for her to imagine a set of facts in which a prosecutor would charge only this crime and not something more serious that would require bail.\n\"This doesn\u2019t strike me as the main charge one would bring,\" said Merkl, who is senior counsel in the Justice Program & Law Enforcement Leaders at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. The Brennan Center is in favor of ending mass incarceration.\nWe looked at arrest records from New York City since 2006 to get a sense of how often police charge this specific crime. We found that in at least 135 arrests, approximately 10 per year, this charge was the top charge. Merkl noted that that the charges that prosecutors decide to bring in a complaint or indictment can be different from those charges that a police file during an arrest. In addition, charges other than the \"top charge\" for these defendants could require detention, even if the top charge does not, according to the Center for Court Innovation.\nRebecca Town, a criminal defense attorney at the Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, which assists low-income people, said the charge cited by the police union is \"almost always\" accompanied by a sex offense under Article 130 of the state penal code, which allows a judge to set cash bail.\n\"If the individual accused is directly responsible for creating such material, they will be charged with something that is directly a sex offense that would still trigger money bail,\" Town said.","cleaned_claim":"Defendants charged with producing, directing or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned & set free.","ambiguity_score":0.7437676787,"paraphrases":[["If you are accused of making, directing, or promoting child pornography, you will be arraigned (officially charged) and then released.",0.7437676787],["If you are charged with producing, directing, or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, you will be arraigned and then released.",0.2768423259],["If you are accused of making, directing, or promoting child pornography, you will be arraigned and then released on bail.",0.2467815131],["Defendants who are charged with producing, directing, or promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child will be arraigned and then released.",0.1143591255],["If you are accused of making, directing, or promoting child pornography, you will be formally charged and then released.",0.6206073165]]}

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., criticized the bill for being paradoxical. She said it was framed as immediate relief for the coronavirus pandemic and its associated economic impacts, yet it allocated money years into the future, when the pandemic will presumably be over.\nDuring a March 4 press conference, Capito said, \"We know that the bill that\u2019s in front of us \u2026 has a lot of money in it for schools, but if you really look at it \u2026 it says that the school money is going to go out until the year 2028. This is supposed to be an emergency bill. It is an emergency to get our schools reopened and our students back to school. We need to get the schools open, and we still have money in the pipeline to do that.\"\nIs some of the \"school money\" in the $1.9 trillion bill scheduled to go out as late as 2028? The short answer is yes.\nCapito\u2019s office pointed us to data from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress\u2019 nonpartisan arbiter of budget figures. As the measure was being considered, CBO released a cost estimate for the section of the bill that falls under the jurisdiction of the House Education and Labor Committee.\nThe CBO estimate counts almost $129 billion of funding in the bill as falling under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund. This accounts for the vast bulk of K-12 education spending in the measure. (Higher education funding is also included in the bill, but Capito\u2019s remarks dealt with K-12 schools.)\nHere\u2019s a year-by-year breakdown of when that roughly $129 billion will be spent:\nAs the chart shows, some money will be spent on K-12 education every year between 2021 and 2028.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that relatively little money will be spent as far out as 2028: Less than 1% of the total spending is scheduled to occur in 2028 itself, and collectively, the years 2026 through 2028 will account for only 10% of the spending.\nThe bulk of the money, about 60%, is to be spent in the middle three years \u2014 2023, 2024, and 2025. About 30% would be spent in 2021 and 2022. (The 2021 fiscal year, which roughly overlaps with the 2020-2021 school year, is already underway. That helps explain the small amount allotted for 2021.)\nIn other words, only about one-third of the money would be spent relatively quickly, supporting Capito\u2019s point. Relatively little money would be spent as late as 2028, but she is correct that some will be.","cleaned_claim":"President Joe Biden\u2019s American Relief Plan has a lot of money in it for schools, but if you really look at it \u2026 it says that the school money is going to go out until the year 2028.","ambiguity_score":0.0543701015,"paraphrases":[["The American Relief Plan proposed by President Joe Biden includes a large sum of money for schools, however if one looks closely it can be seen that the funds allocated for schools will only last until 2028.",0.0543701015],["President Joe Biden's American Relief Plan includes a lot of funding for schools, but if you look closely, it says that the money for schools will be distributed until 2028.",0.0418468155],["The American Relief Plan proposed by President Joe Biden includes a lot of funding for schools, but if you take a closer look, you'll see that the money for schools is only designated to last until 2028.",0.0509098098],["President Joe Biden's American Relief Plan includes a lot of funding for schools, but if you look closely, it says that the money will be dispersed until 2028.",0.0458472893],["The American Relief Plan put forth by President Joe Biden includes a significant amount of funding for schools.

We rated that False.\nThis time, on top of that, Biden misrepresents what the Second Amendment says.\nSecond Amendment places no limits, experts say\nThe text of the Second Amendment is short: \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nUniversity of Tennessee law professor Glenn Harlan Reynolds said the amendment\u2019s few words speak for themselves.\n\"The Second Amendment places no limits on individual ownership of cannon, or any other arms,\" Reynolds said.\nThere have been many court cases to resolve whether the amendment confers an individual right to bear arms. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it does.\nSetting aside ongoing disagreements over that ruling, Fordham University law professor Nicholas Johnson said, \"The amendment limited government action, not people.\"\n\"The first federal gun control law does not appear until the 20th century,\" Johnson said.\nThat law, the National Firearms Act, came in 1934 when machine guns were the weapon of choice of Prohibition Era gangsters. (The law was drafted before Prohibition ended in 1933.) When U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings made the case for the law before the House Ways and Means Committee, he based it on the government\u2019s power to tax and regulate interstate commerce, not the Second Amendment.\n\"If we made a statute absolutely forbidding any human being to have a machine gun, you might say there is some constitutional question involved,\" Cummings said April 16, 1934. \"But when you say \u2018We will tax the machine gun\u2019 and when you say that \u2018the absence of a license showing payment of the tax has been made indicates that a crime has been perpetrated,\u2019 you are easily within the law.\"\nThe debate that framed the Second Amendment\nFrom the way Biden put it, the Second Amendment regulated weapons. The more immediate driver in 1787 was the desire to keep the federal government in check.\nThe framers of the Constitution agreed that a federal government might need a standing army. But coming out from under one despot, they wanted to avoid creating another. This was something that Federalists and Anti-Federalists could agree on, wrote Valparaiso law professor David Vandercoy.\n\"Both believed the greatest danger to the new republic was tyrannical government and that the ultimate check on tyranny was an armed population,\" Vandercoy wrote in 1994.\nRestricting weapons to control perceived threats\nThere were some state and local laws after the Second Amendment was adopted in 1792 that limited firearms.\nThe most sweeping ones barred Black people, free or enslaved, from owning them.\nA 1792 Virginia law, for example, said, \"No Negro or mulatto whatsoever shall keep or carry any gun, powder, shot, club or other weapon whatsoever.\"\nHistorian Saul Cornell at Fordham found other laws aimed at controlling certain groups. Some banned gun ownership by people who backed the British. Others targeted Native Americans.\nCornell also pointed to a 1795 Massachusetts law that mainly targeted rioters but gave local authorities broad latitude to arrest people who carried firearms.\n\"The (National Rifle Association) will call out Biden, correctly, that there were no modern style gun control laws in the Founding era because there was little interpersonal gun violence among persons of European origin,\" Cornell said. \"Gun control groups will correctly say that a variety of robust regulations existed at the time of the Second Amendment and that the Founders feared anarchy as much as tyranny.\"\nCornell argues that for about the first 50 years after passage of the Second Amendment, gun technology was limited. The issues of crime and safety that drive the modern debate, he said, didn\u2019t begin to emerge until manufacturers began producing reliable, affordable guns in greater volume.","cleaned_claim":"The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and what type of weapon you could own.","ambiguity_score":0.0501036942,"paraphrases":[["The Second Amendment, from the day it was passed, limited the type of people who could own a gun and the types of weapons they could own.",0.0200378466],["The Second Amendment, when it was first passed, restricted who could own a gun and what type of gun they could own.",0.0206003524],["The Second Amendment has always placed restrictions on who can own a gun and what kind of gun they can own.",0.0501036942],["The Second Amendment has always placed limits on who can own a gun and what kinds of guns they can own.",0.045165915]]}

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe claim appears to be based on an answer Biden gave during a Sept. 17 CNN presidential town hall meeting. During the televised event, Julie Masser Ballay, a Pennsylvania farmer and Republican, asked Biden how he plans to decrease the regulatory burden for farmers. Ballay referenced the threat of increased regulation of farms, particularly through the proposed Green New Deal.\nBiden answered: \"Number one, we should provide for your ability to make a lot more money, as farmers, by dealing with you being able to put land in land banks, and you get paid to do that to provide for more open space and provide for the ability of you to be able to be in a position that we are going to pay you for planting certain crops that in fact absorb carbon from the air,\" according to a transcript of the event.\nAgricultural programs similar to land banks already exist in the United States. For example, the Conservation Reserve Program administered by the Farm Service Agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture pays farmers a yearly rental fee if they agree to \"remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality,\" according to the Farm Service Agency.\nSimilarly, the Conservation Stewardship Program that Biden vowed to expand already includes a grasslands conservation initiative that pays farmers to turn cropland into grass or pasture.\nBiden\u2019s remark that \"we will pay you for planting certain crops that in fact absorb carbon from the air\" is likely a reference to his proposal to expand the Conservation Stewardship program to pay farmers for \"practices to protect the environment, including carbon sequestrestration,\" according to his answer to the Presidential Candidate Questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau.\nCertain crops, including \"cover crops,\" are important to carbon sequestration, according to Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, part of USDA.\nWe contacted Biden\u2019s campaign for comment but did not receive a reply.\nThe programs are voluntary, not mandatory. So to the extent a hypothetical Biden administration is telling farmers what plants to grow, it\u2019s only because the farmers agreed to do so in the first place.","cleaned_claim":"Joe Biden wants American farmers to put their farmland into Gvt \u2018land banks.\u2019 Gvt would then tell farmers what \u2018sustainable\u2019 plants they could grow.","ambiguity_score":0.2555004656,"paraphrases":[["Joe Biden is proposing that farmers put their farmland into government-run \"land banks.\" These banks would then tell farmers what types of \"sustainable\" plants they could grow.",0.0571522303],["Joe Biden is suggesting that farmers should put their land into government-run \"land banks.\" These banks would then tell farmers what types of \"sustainable\" plants they could grow.",0.0459401496],["Joe Biden has proposed that farmers should be encouraged to put their farmland into government-run \"land banks.\" These land banks would then dictate to farmers what \"sustainable\" crops they could grow.",0.2555004656],["Joe Biden wants farmers to put their land into government-controlled \"land banks.\" The government would then tell farmers what plants they could grow, based on what is considered \"sustainable.\"",0.0632816255],["Joe Biden is proposing that farmers should put their land into government-run land banks.

The House passed something close to universal basic income once in 1970 and once in 1971, not twice in 1971.\nOverall, Yang\u2019s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.","full_article":"Giving every American adult $1,000 a month may sound like a gimmick or too good to be true, but Andrew Yang says it\u2019s a \"deeply American idea\" dating back centuries.\n\"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen\u2019s dividend.

It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\nYang, an entrepreneur seeking the Democratic nomination for president, has made similar claims on Twitter and while debating fellow Democrats.\nYang\u2019s Freedom Dividend plan is a form of universal basic income, guaranteeing $1,000 a month to every U.S. citizen over 18 years old, without having to pass a test or meet a work requirement.\nPolitiFact decided to look into the history of universal basic income, particularly Yang\u2019s reference to Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 1970s legislation. We found that his comparisons are broadly correct, but not precise.\n\"Thomas Paine was for it at our founding, called it the citizen\u2019s dividend.\"\nPaine wrote that Earth in its \"natural uncultivated state\" was the common property of the human race. He believed that cultivation and private land ownership deprived non-landowners of their \"natural inheritance.\"\nPaine suggested a national fund to compensate individuals for that loss, whether they were rich or poor. He proposed a one-time payment of 15 pounds to every person when they turned 21 years old; and that every person aged 50, and all others who arrived at that age, be paid 10 pounds annually for the rest of their lives.\nPaine\u2019s proposal in the 1790s pamphlet Agrarian Justice was in some ways an early version of the Social Security program and has an element of universal basic income, said Harvey J. Kaye, a democracy and justice studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay. But it wasn\u2019t the same thing.\nAlso, Paine\u2019s plan wasn't published at the founding of the United States in 1776 but about two decades later, inspired by the French Revolution, said Gary Berton, coordinator for the Institute for Thomas Paine Studies at Iona College and secretary of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association. Paine also never used the term \"citizen's dividend\" in relation to his proposal (he called it \"the plan\"), Berton said.\n\"Martin Luther King, champion in the \u201860s, called it a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans, and it is what he was fighting for on the day he was killed in 1968.\"\nIt is true that King supported a guaranteed income in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?\" But he wasn\u2019t explicitly advocating for it on the day he was killed.\nKing wrote that past approaches to fighting poverty (particularly housing programs, education, and family counseling) were not coordinated, developed at different rates, and were indirect approaches to solving poverty.\n\"I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective \u2014 the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,\" King wrote.\nYang is on solid footing in claiming that King sought a form of guaranteed income, even if King is not well known for that position, said Doug E. Thompson, a history professor and director of the Spencer B. King Jr. Center for Southern Studies at Mercer University.\nKing was killed April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn. He was there to prepare for a march on behalf of sanitation workers who were striking and advocating for better working conditions and better pay. King saw the strike as a good way to highlight the need for his Poor People\u2019s Campaign, Thompson said.\n\"Guaranteed income was not on the table in Memphis as much as the plight of folks who worked hard in the U.S. but could not overcome the wealth gaps that kept poor people in cycles of poverty,\" Thompson said. \"It would have been an outgrowth of Memphis, but not its central focus.\"\n\"It passed the U.S. House of Representatives twice in 1971.\"\nThe House in 1970 and 1971 passed bills that \"were as close as the U.S. has come to passing something resembling a universal basic income,\" said Brian Steensland, professor and chair of sociology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis.\nThe New York Times in April 1970 reported that the Democrat-led House voted 243-155 for President Richard Nixon\u2019s revision of the welfare system, establishing \"for the first time the principle that the government should guarantee every family a minimum annual income, even if one or more of its members is working.\" The proposal included a work requirement. In June 1971, the House again voted 288-132 for an omnibus bill that included a proposal to guarantee families an annual income.\nWhile there was wide interest in the 1960s and early 1970s for a \"guaranteed annual income,\" the specifics of what the term meant, the proposals, and related discourse changed over time.\n\"Nixon\u2019s plan was more \u2018conservative\u2019 than many of the available guaranteed annual income plans at the time, and his rhetoric was more conservative than the plans themselves,\" Steensland said. \"His rhetoric was very work-oriented. Nixon constantly referenced moving people from the \u2018welfare rolls\u2019 to the \u2018payrolls,\u2019 though in fact many of the recipients would have received income from both sources.\"\nAnother key point about the Nixon plan: It was based on a negative income tax model, meaning the total amount distributed would have depended on recipients\u2019 income level. Universal basic income proposals, like Yang\u2019s, seek to give everyone a flat amount, regardless of how much money they make.","cleaned_claim":"About universal basic income, Thomas Paine was for it at our founding ...

Putting them on planes, putting them on buses.\"\nDeSantis doubled down in a fundraising letter later that day: \"Joe Biden has the nerve to tell me to get out of the way on COVID while he lets COVID-infected migrants pour over our southern border by the hundreds of thousands. No elected official is doing more to enable the transmission of COVID in America than Joe Biden with his open borders policies.\"\nPublic health experts said it\u2019s reasonable to be concerned about coronavirus spreading among migrants, especially if they\u2019re living in close quarters. \"It would be fair to say that detention centers, like prisons, are likely to be 'hotspots' for transmission,\" said Babak Javid, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco. \"We saw a lot of this last year,\" earlier in the pandemic.\nBut they said there is no evidence it\u2019s happening on the scale that DeSantis described.\nIt may well be that immigrants coming illegally into the country are contributing to COVID-19 caseloads, \"but given the extensive transmission already in the U.S., the immigration contribution is akin to pouring a bucket of water into a swimming pool,\" said William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. \"It\u2019s hard to measure and pretty trivial.\"\nU.S.-Mexico border not \u2018wide open\u2019\nIn a statement, DeSantis press secretary Christina Pushaw focused on the migrants who make it across the border without detection. She acknowledged that migration is not the only factor in COVID-19 spread.\n\"We know tens of thousands of migrants cross the border illegally every month,\" she said. \"Officials don\u2019t have a precise number, because the border is porous, and it stands to reason that many people enter undetected. ... Some of those countries where a significant portion of the migrants hail from, such as Haiti, have extremely low rates of COVID vaccination.\"\nStill, it is wrong to say, as DeSantis did, that the southern border is \"wide open\" for everyone to just come into the country. Most people who are encountered are turned away under a public health law invoked by Trump\u2019s administration and continued by Biden.\nBorder officials \u2014 at and between ports of entries \u2014 recorded more than 822,000 encounters with migrants from February to June, and most of those people were expelled under the public health law. These individuals don\u2019t get to stay in the country to request asylum or other immigration protection.\nNicole Hallett, a professor and director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, told PolitiFact that the apprehension numbers reflect that people trying and failing to cross multiple times.\n\"Apprehensions have increased because of the strict COVID restrictions, not because restrictions have eased,\" Hallett said.\nThe Biden administration has allowed certain groups of migrants to file for immigration protection, such as children arriving alone at the southern border and some families with young children. The Department of Homeland Security, however, said it had recently resumed expedited removal flights for certain families who recently arrived at the southern border.\nOfficials in February began to let in asylum seekers who were waiting for a resolution of their U.S. immigration cases in Mexico under the Trump-era Remain in Mexico program. (Biden ended that program in June.)\nThe United States is also temporarily limiting inbound land border crossings from Mexico; non-essential travel is not allowed.\nCustoms and Border Protection told PolitiFact in April that personnel do initial inspections for symptoms or risk factors associated with COVID-19 and consult with onsite medical personnel, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or local health systems as appropriate.\nDHS also said in April that it works with state and local authorities and non-governmental organizations to make sure that all migrants are tested for COVID-19 \"at some point during their immigration journey.\"\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the chance of coronavirus spread on the border is zero. For instance, McAllen, Texas, along the border with Mexico, has seen an increasing number of migrants arriving in recent weeks. According to the city, more than 7,000 migrants have tested positive for the coronavirus, out of 87,000 migrants who had passed through the city.\nBut drawing a clear line between migrants and the spread of the coronavirus throughout the U.S., as DeSantis did, requires a sense of how many migrants are evading detection and how many of them are infected.\n\"Otherwise, it is a statement without any facts to substantiate it,\" said Nicole Gatto, an associate professor in Claremont Graduate University\u2019s school of community and global health.\nThe current surge is driven by community spread\nThe data for coronavirus cases provides poor support for the notion that the virus is being spread by illegal immigration.\nSignificant outbreaks are happening well inland from the border, in states like Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and Missouri. Public health experts express skepticism that illegal border crossings are to blame for these outbreaks.\n(This map, by the Washington Post, shows the seven-day average of reported cases for each U.S. county, per 100,000 residents. Reprinted with permission; updated versions available here.)\nIf DeSantis were correct, the land border between the U.S. and Mexico would be among the hardest-hit parts of the country, since even if migrants eventually disperse to other locations, they would have an impact on coronavirus rates locally first.\nHowever, the entire land border between San Diego and the southern tip of Texas shows relatively low case rates compared with the entire southeastern quadrant of the U.S.\nGiven this data, \"it doesn't seem right that illegal immigration is driving the current surge,\" said Javid, the University of California-San Francisco professor.\nThere\u2019s also a more plausible explanation for the coronavirus surge\u2019s current pattern: Case rates are higher in places with lower rates of vaccination.\nAn analysis by the New York Times found that at the end of July, counties with vaccination rates below 30% had coronavirus case rates well over double the case rates in counties with at least 60% vaccination. And five of the six least-vaccinated states \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi \u2014 are all squarely within the geographical quadrant of the country that has the highest case rates.\nSome of the hardest-hit places, such as southwestern Missouri, are far from the border, while others, such as southern Louisiana, are on the water.\n\"The pattern of distribution of coronavirus cases does not correspond in any way to immigrant movement,\" said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. \"And the paths to \u2018bringing\u2019 COVID here are many, including tourists, diplomats, boat workers, student exchange, and cruises.\"\nCaplan said he views DeSantis\u2019 statements as the latest in a long history of efforts to offload blame for infectious diseases on immigrants.\n\"The notion of immigrants bringing disease has been alleged about Gypsies, Jews, Italians, Irish, and Blacks,\" he said. \"As we know from Ebola, SARS, and influenza, infections get here all the time. The issue is what we do to stop their spread.\"","cleaned_claim":"Joe Biden has driven the current coronavirus surge because he imported more virus from around the world by having a wide open southern border.","ambiguity_score":0.0620432682,"paraphrases":[["Joe Biden has caused the current surge in coronavirus cases by importing more virus from around the world through the southern border.",0.0174345113],["Joe Biden is responsible for the recent surge in coronavirus cases because he allowed more virus into the country by having an open southern border.",0.0287259314],["Joe Biden's policies have resulted in a surge in coronavirus cases, as he has allowed more viruses to come into the country from other parts of the world.",0.0260800011],["Joe Biden's lax border policies have led to a surge in coronavirus cases in the US, as he has allowed more infected people to enter the country from other parts of the world.",0.0620432682],["The current surge in coronavirus cases can be attributed to Joe Biden's decision to leave the southern border open, which has allowed more virus to enter the country.",0.0190777089]]}

However, he exaggerated the extent of Comey\u2019s concerns when he said that Comey indicated that \"we cannot figure out\" who they are, and that we have \"no information on them.\" All told, Comey said the vetting process is thorough, but imperfect.\nThe statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.","full_article":"During a U.S. Senate debate at the City Club of Cleveland, incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman was asked for his views about refugees from Syria and what the U.S. role should be.\nPortman said that refugees face a dire situation due to actions of the Syrian government, but it would not be wise for the United States to increase the number of refugees admitted.\n\"Before the Homeland Security Committee, the director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who these people are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don\u2019t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that,\" Portman said. \"That to me is not a good thing for the United States to do.\"\nIs that what FBI Director James Comey said? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nThe United States vets all refugees through an extensive process that involves the FBI, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department and other agencies.\nThe process can take two or even three years, as Democrat Ted Strickland said during the debate. Refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks, and because of special concerns about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles.\nExperts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor.\nComey spoke to the Homeland Security Committees of both chambers of Congress last year, sharing much the same opinion both times. His opinion was not exactly what Portman implied.\nWhen Comey spoke before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey whether there is concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases don\u2019t contain complete information for every refugee.\nComey said the procedure isn\u2019t perfect. \"We can only query against that which we have collected,\" Comey said. \"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but ... there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person.\"\nSo Comey was saying that, despite the thoroughness of the process, he couldn\u2019t guarantee there would never be a problem or that no terrorist would ever slip through the cracks.\nComey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because the United States has had a presence there for more than a decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant.\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the same hearing that it\u2019s possible a refugee could have an unknown criminal past or suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States.\nThat said, despite the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said the process works and has been improving over the years.\n\"The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago,\" Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. \"The bad news is, there is no risk-free process.\"\nComey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8.\n\"There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that,\" he told the Senate committee. \"From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. \u2026 I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps.\"\nHe repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22.\n\"We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news,\" Comey said. \"The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria.\"\nWe\u2019ll also note that, especially given the extra scrutiny for Syrian refugees, experts have told us it \"makes no operational sense\" for ISIS to take advantage of the refugee program.\n\n\"Given how easy it is to send a European extremist to the U.S. via Europe, why would an ISIS guy in Syria wait the three years it takes to get refugee status?\" Anne Speckhard, a counterterrorism expert at Georgetown University, told us previously.\nFinally, we should note that we\u2019ve looked at claims from Donald Trump before that the United States doesn\u2019t have a system to vet refugees. That more extreme claim is False. Portman\u2019s claim offers more nuance and context.","cleaned_claim":"The director of the FBI said that we cannot figure out who Syrian refugees are, what their intentions are, because we have no information on them, because we don\u2019t have any contact with the Syrian government or any people on the ground to be able to determine that.","ambiguity_score":0.7109510899,"paraphrases":[["The director of the FBI said that we do not have enough information on Syrian refugees to determine their identities or intentions.

If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,\" Trump said Nov. 5.\nWe asked Trump spokespersons which votes he considered \"illegal\" and did not hear back. However, the rest of Trump\u2019s remarks show that he questioned the timing of mail ballot arrivals and the counting in certain battleground states.\nAs Trump continues to perpetuate a myth about widespread voter fraud, he hasn\u2019t proved that illegal votes influenced the election.\n\"So far we have seen no credible evidence of illegal votes in any state that could potentially tip the results of the election to Trump,\" UC Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said Nov. 6. \"Assuming Biden wins Pennsylvania, I see no path for Trump to litigate his way to victory based upon unsubstantiated claims of fraud.\"\nThe idea that Democrats would orchestrate a nationwide felonious scheme to count illegal votes would require voters and election workers in various counties (Democrats and Republicans) to coordinate and take actions that risk prison time. And it defies logic that such a scheme would take place that would aim to keep Trump out of the White House but have Republicans win seats in the House and potentially retain control of the Senate.\nRepublicans govern some of the states Trump has challenged vote counting. Nevada has a Republican secretary of state. Georgia has a Republican secretary of state and governor. Arizona has a Republican governor.\nThe legal process of counting ballots continues\nThe regular counting of legal ballots continued at the time of Trump\u2019s remarks in a handful of battleground states.\nTrump has targeted \"late\" ballots, but that\u2019s inaccurate. State laws specify when mail ballots must be postmarked or arrive in order to be counted, and the grace period (if there is one) varies by state. States also vary in their policies on how early election officials can start processing mail ballots.\nElection officials have been following the processes in their state laws to verify and tabulate ballots. They have been rejecting ballots that violated state laws, such as omitting the signature on the envelope or sending it in past the state\u2019s deadline, and only counting ballots that are legal, said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research. Many states give voters time to correct signature issues.\nThere are policies, too, across many states allowing political parties or others to deploy observers to watch the ballot verification and counting. Who can observe and what they can watch (and especially in the pandemic, how many can be in the room) can vary by state, but the underlying principle is transparency.\nSteven Huefner, an election law expert at Ohio State University, said questionable ballots are set aside and not counted as they await an official review.\n\"Might an election official make a mistake and count a ballot that should not have been counted? Sure. Is there any evidence that has happened this election? Not that I have seen,\" Huefner said.\nLitigation doesn\u2019t prove election stealing\nTrump and his allies have filed lawsuits in an effort to challenge vote counting and other procedures in states with close races. Judges have thrown out lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign in Michigan and Georgia. In Pennsylvania, a federal judge denied a request to halt ballot counting in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania Republicans filed an emergency U.S. Supreme Court request related to the arrival of mail ballots.\nLitigation remains pending targeting Clark County in Nevada, the most populous county in the state with the highest number of Democrats and home to Las Vegas.\nThe lawsuit alleged that in Clark County there were \"over 3,000 instances of ineligible individuals casting ballots. Ballots have even been cast on behalf of deceased voters.\" The Nevada Republican Party sent information to the U.S. Department of Justice that alleged that 3,062 voters were no longer living in Nevada when they cast their ballots. The lawsuit also challenges the county\u2019s use of a machine as a step in signature verification.\nWhether any of those 3,000 or so voters were indeed ineligible to cast a vote remains to be seen. However there are circumstances under which a person who has moved can still cast a Nevada ballot, including if they left the state temporarily, are in the military or are students.\nRegardless, 3,000 votes (and assuming all such votes went to Biden) would not make up the difference for Trump as of Friday afternoon, when Biden led in Nevada by about 20,000 votes.\nClark County Registrar Joe Gloria, who administers the election, said Nov. 5, \"We are not aware of any improper ballots that are being processed.\"\nNevada expanded voting by mail due to the pandemic, which Gloria said resulted in a slower process to complete the count. But he explained that election officials are taking the steps required to verify ballots.\nBen Hovland, chairman of the bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance Commission, told PolitiFact that there was no evidence of illegal votes being counted to steal the election. Trump has made claims of widespread voter fraud repeatedly, including in 2016 when he said millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote, a claim we rated Pants on Fire.\n\"Time and time again when rubber hits the road there is no evidence, no evidence in academic after academic study, in court case after court case \u2014 there was whole presidential commission election integrity to track down widespread voter fraud \u2014\u00a0none of those cases found widespread voter fraud,\" Hovland said.\nIt\u2019s possible when all the vote counting is finished that election officials will find some cases of fraudulent votes cast, but there is no evidence of widespread fraud.\n\"The reality is voter fraud in this country is limited,\" Hovland said. \"It is isolated cases, usually small races where a few votes make a difference.\"\nRELATED: Fact-checking Trump\u2019s election fraud falsehoods in White House remarks","cleaned_claim":"If you count the legal votes, I easily win.

But PolitiFact found no proof that such a practice was taking place in Texas.\nFox News did not offer comment for this fact-check.\nNo sign that airborne de-icing is used in Texas\nA spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages more than 90% of the state\u2019s electric load, said she had not heard of such rumors until PolitiFact reached out.\nWhile frozen wind turbine blades can be manually de-iced, the extreme weather would have made it difficult to do so in Texas, where several airports were closed during the storm, said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute.\n\"No one I\u2019ve asked in the Texas wind industry has heard of any aircraft de-icing of wind turbine blades,\" said Krane, who recently wrote about the need to winterize Texas\u2019 energy system.\n\"Most wind turbines here don\u2019t have any de-icing equipment, since it\u2019s rare to have need for them here,\" added Daniel Cohan, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Rice University, and a colleague of Krane\u2019s.\nRWE Renewables Americas operates more than a dozen wind farms in Texas. Its Roscoe Wind Farm, a few hours west of Fort Worth, has more than 600 turbines.\nThe company said Feb. 18 that icing and grid issues put part of its onshore wind fleet out of service. But spokesperson Matt Tulis denied using helicopters in the way Logan described.\n\"We are not using helicopters to spray oil on our turbines to defrost them,\" Tulis told PolitiFact. \"We don\u2019t apply any kind of de-icing agent to the turbine or turbine blades.\"\nTurbines in places that regularly see low temperatures are often designed to withstand the cold. Some have ice-resistant coatings or heaters built into the blades.\nThose technologies used elsewhere in the world allow wind turbines to produce electricity at temperatures as low as 22 degrees below zero, Krane and his colleagues at the Baker Institute wrote for Forbes.

There are some ways to legally access the Internet in Cuba, but not in one's home, or on mobile devices, and not by connecting to the full World Wide Web. Internet use is primarily restricted to government-run access points that are heavily monitored. The usage rates, set by the regime, are so expensive that it is cost prohibitive for most Cubans to log on. Political dissenters are barred from publishing online and are punished if they do. The end result is similar to full prohibition: Cuba has one of the lowest rates of Internet access in the world.\nThe U.S. sanctions have played a role in limited availability of technology. However, Rubio is right that the Cuban government has nearly complete control over the Internet. That isn\u2019t a result of sanctions on telecommunication business activity in Cuba. Even if the United States fully repeals its embargo, government control over Internet access could continue.\nWe rate Rubio\u2019s statement Mostly True.","full_article":"There\u2019s a good chance most Cubans won\u2019t be able to read this article. And the reason why \u2014 lack of Internet access \u2014 is a point of a contention between President Barack Obama and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.\nObama on Wednesday, Dec. 17 announced sweeping changes to the United States\u2019 decades-old isolation policy against Cuba, promising renewed diplomatic relations and an easing of regulations on commerce. Obama said the drastic shift in approach to the Communist-controlled island would help bolster the Cuban people, who he said have suffered from America\u2019s cold shoulder.\n\"I believe in the free flow of information,\" Obama said. \"Unfortunately, our sanctions on Cuba have denied Cubans access to technology that has empowered individuals around the globe.\"\nRubio, a Florida Republican and a Cuban American, chastised Obama\u2019s comments in an animated rebuttal.\n\"The president said that the people of Cuba do not have access to advanced, 21st century modern technology for communications and telecommunications because of the U.S. embargo. That is false,\" Rubio said. \"The reason why they don't have access to 21st century telecommunications \u2014 like smart phones, like access to the Internet \u2014 is because it is illegal in Cuba.\"\nObama\u2019s statement wasn\u2019t as full-throated as Rubio made it sound. And some of what Obama suggested is true, experts told us.\nThat said, Rubio has the better part of the argument that Cuba\u2019s restrictive policies loom large over the debate.\nCuba\u2019s restrictions\nCuba has\u00a0less access to the Internet than most countries in the world. It is the only country in the Western Hemisphere with an Internet access rating of \"not free\" by Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group.\nCiting the National Statistics Office in Cuba, Freedom House said about 23 percent of Cubans have access to the Internet. But those numbers, while very low, are likely inflated: Many of those people have access only to a tightly controlled Cuban intranet that includes email and government-approved sites. Outside experts, Freedom House said, estimate only about 5 percent of people have access to the full World Wide Web.\nThe government of Cuba maintains almost complete control over telecommunications industries in the country, and it uses a mix of repressive policies and price gouging to keep Cubans offline. Regulations essentially prohibit private Internet use in homes and it is illegal\u00a0to access the Internet outside government-controlled methods. On top of that, the cost of even a basic computer is more than twice the average Cuban\u2019s annual salary.\nCubans who log on to the Internet do so via public, government-run access points. There, patrons deal with some of the slowest speeds in the world. And rates set by the government make it difficult for the average worker on a $20 weekly salary to consistently log on. Checking email costs $1.50 an hour. Access to the national intranet is $0.60 per hour, and international websites are $4.50 per hour, Freedom House said.\nBloggers and dissenters are quickly shut down and, in many cases, imprisoned. Alan Gross, the imprisoned American contractor released by Cuba this week, was arrested for building telecommunications infrastructure on the island.\nAs for smartphones, most mobile phones can send messages, even internationally, but cannot access the Internet. GPS and satellite capabilities are prohibited. An iPhone, if procured, would be a pretty dumb phone in Cuba.\nCuban officials have recently indicated a potential shift in policy that could open the Internet to personal and mobile usage, but it\u2019s also possible it will be limited to Cuba\u2019s intranet and email.\nSuch promises have been made before. Cuba installed a 1,600 kilometer fiber-optic cable between the island and Venezuela in 2011 with financial help from China (a project completed despite the U.S. embargo, it should be noted). It was supposed to increase speeds and access for Cubans. Actual advances have been modest.\nAnd it\u2019s not as though the United States is the only country capable of supplying Cuba with telecommunications technology in today\u2019s global economy. The regime has prioritized preventing political dissent over technological advancement. There\u2019s no guarantee that will change if U.S. policy does.\nThis is why Rubio is right in saying that the U.S. embargo is far from the only factor affecting access. Sure, Cuba is poor and has bad infrastructure, but there are poorer countries with better Internet access, said Larry Press, an information systems professor at California State University Dominguez Hills who writes a blog on Internet access in Cuba. When infrastructure improved in Cuba, access largely did not.\n\"I think Rubio is closer to the truth than Obama,\" Press said. \"Both have a degree of truth, but the Cuban government's fear of the Internet was a bigger hindrance than the embargo.\"\nThe embargo effect\nRubio was not quite right, however, when he said that Obama\u2019s comment was unequivocally false.\nObama said that U.S. sanctions on Cuba \"have denied Cubans access to technology.\" This is true to a certain extent. Part of Cubans\u2019 access problem has to do with the exorbitant cost of technology, relative to how poor the country is, and lifting those restrictions could help that problem.\nIn 2009, Obama cracked the door open marginally for American telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba by allowing them to establish connectivity between Cuba and the United States, and letting satellite radio and television companies serve Cuban customers. Additionally, people could donate (but not sell) telecommunication devices like computers and phones to Cubans.\nThe changes announced Dec. 17 further opened up the ability for U.S. companies to build telecommunications infrastructure in Cuba and it allows for the commercial sale of communication devices and software.\nMatt Borman, deputy assistant secretary of export administration, told PolitiFact that if American companies were able to compete with other foreign telecommunications suppliers in Cuba, there is an expectation that it would pressure the government to create more viable infrastructure. That could spur more Internet freedom. In a report published in 2010, the Brookings Institution\u00a0made a similar argument.\nA of couple experts told us that Obama\u2019s side carries weight because Castro has made an effort in recent years to ease some restrictions, such as lifting the ban on personal computers. (It may be hard to believe, but internet access in Cuba used to be even worse.) So the United States\u2019 sanctions prevent Cubans from acquiring technology that is now legal, said Julia Sweig, an expert on Cuba and Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations.","cleaned_claim":"The reason why Cubans don't have access to 21st century telecommunications \u2014 like smart phones, like access to the Internet \u2014 is because it is illegal in Cuba.","ambiguity_score":0.0136207147,"paraphrases":[["The reason that Cubans do not have access to modern telecommunications is because it is illegal in Cuba.

The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people.\"\nMaher based his ISIS estimate on a widely reported estimate, though the White House has downgraded the official estimate a bit.\nIt\u2019s Maher\u2019s tally of surrounding armies that needs more explanation. He's including reservists \u2014 not just active military and paramilitary \u2014 in his definition of \"army.\"\nThe question of which nations to include as \"surrounding\" countries is more subjective. Maher is folding in five that don't share a border with ISIS' strongholds but nonetheless play key roles in Arab affairs.\nWe think the statement needs that kind of clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.","full_article":"Comedian and social commentator Bill Maher, in a Feb. 10 essay for The Hollywood Reporter, wanted to know why the terrorist group ISIS is doing so well in the Middle East when so many nearby countries with big militaries want it gone.\n\"Why don't they fight their own battles? Why are Muslim armies so useless against ISIS? ISIS isn't 10 feet tall. There are 20,000 or 30,000 of them. The countries surrounding ISIS have armies totaling 5 million people. So why do we have to be the ones leading the fight? Or be in the fight at all?\"\nWe were wondering if Maher's numbers were correct and Islamic State fighters are potentially outgunned by as much as 250 to 1 in the region.\nISIS size\nIn the past, we've found reliable estimates of the strength of ISIS, also known as ISIL, are hard to come by. United States intelligence data from May to August of 2014 put the number at 20,000 to 31,500 fighters. Media reports at the time, based on unnamed sources, put the number at anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000.\nMaher\u2019s spokesman, Adam Schiff, said the comedian was going by that widely available U.S. estimate.\nThe latest U.S. estimate is 19,000 to 25,000 released by the White House on Feb. 4. The Obama administration contends that the fight against ISIS has brought the number down. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the numbers show ISIS is finding it increasingly harder to find replacements for the thousands of fighters who have been killed.\nSo Maher is still in the ballpark.\nSurrounding militaries\nBut what about the militaries surrounding ISIS?\nWe turned to the World Bank's website and its tally of armed forces personnel in various countries. The most recent counts listed are for the year 2013. The website says its source is \"The Military Balance,\" published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\nIf you consider the countries bordering Iraq and Syria \u2014\u00a0Iran (with 563,000 armed forces personnel), Jordan (115,500), Kuwait (22,600), Lebanon (80,000), Saudi Arabia (251,500) and Turkey (612,800) \u2014\u00a0you get a total of 1.6 million.\nAdd in Iraq (177,600) and Syria (178,000) themselves and that brings the total to 2 million. That's less than half of Maher\u2019s figure.\nWhen we heard back from Maher's spokesman, he said the comedian was also including the armies of Bahrain, Egypt, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\nHe's obviously using a broader definition of \"surrounding\" countries. Oman is about 560 miles from its closest border with Iraq.\nPutting that aside, if you add those five additional states into the mix, you're still 2 million soldiers shy of the 5 million cited by Maher.\nSchiff said Maher was relying on numbers from Wikipedia, specifically the \"List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel\" page. It lists the 2014 edition of \"The Military Balance\" as the source.\nMaher took the totals for those 13 countries and came up with 4.95 million.\nWe wondered how both Wikipedia and the World Bank could cite the same data source and still be so far apart. The difference comes down to reservists.\nThe World Bank total includes both military and paramilitary personnel on active duty serving full time. The totals on the Wikipedia page add in reserve forces who are not active military but are available for mobilization if necessary. If they're included as part of a country's army, the total for those 13 countries Maher wants to include rises to 4.95 million, as Maher said.\nIf you don't include the reservists, the number of troops in the countries cited by the comedian only rises to 3.6 million.\nIt all boils down to two questions.\nFirst, whether five countries cited by Maher, none of which share a border with Iraq and Syria, should be considered \"surrounding\" countries.\nSecond, whether reservists should be considered part of a country's army. On that point, we will note that about half of the U.S. troops in Iraq in 2005 were reservists.\nAll of the countries Maher is counting except Syria and Iran (which are waging their own efforts against ISIS) are part of a 66-country coalition that has pledged to eliminate the threat posed by the terrorist group. However, some may be doing little more than letting the United States use their country as a staging point for airstrikes. Surrounding countries have not played a major role in the campaign.\nMichael Desch, co-director of the\u00a0international security program at the University of Notre Dame, said the Arab states either have inept armies or are preoccupied with domestic threats (or both). In addition, counter-insurgency operations typically require 10 to 20 as many troops to succeed.\n\"Given all that, it is no mystery ISIS has proven to be a tough nut to crack despite its relatively small numbers,\" he said.","cleaned_claim":"Why are Muslim armies so useless against ISIS? ...

It aimed to start \"a John the Baptist type movement to fast and pray in preparation for a 3rd great awakening.\"\nIn 2010, Engle traveled to Kampala, Uganda, to be the guest of honor at a Sunday prayer and rally about \"homosexuality, witchcraft, corruption and the fear of violence leading up to the country\u2019s presidential election next year,\" the New York Times reported.\nUganda's President Yoweri Museveni signs a new anti-gay bill that sets harsh penalties for homosexual sex, in Entebbe, Uganda Monday, Feb. 24, 2014.

A different version of the bill, which imposed life sentences instead of the death penalty, was signed into law in 2014, resulting in sanctions from the United States and other countries. A court annulled it later that year due to a legislative technicality.\nEngle was not directly linked to the legislation in Uganda, and he issued a statement ahead of his rally condemning the bill\u2019s harsh penalties for homosexuality. However, during his rally in Kampala, Engle did praise the country\u2019s \"courage\" and \"righteousness\" in pursuing the bill, the Times reported.\nWhat is the National Christian Foundation?\nThe National Christian Foundation is a Georgia-based religious nonprofit and one of the largest charities in the United States. It was founded in 1982 by tax attorney Terry Parker, financial adviser Ron Blue and evangelical Christian author Larry Burkett.\nThe National Christian Foundation gave TheCall $500 in 2009 and $300 in 2010, according to the group\u2019s public tax documents. In 2008, TheCall received a much larger donation from the foundation \u2014\u00a0more than $160,000.\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent those donations were explicitly for traveling to Uganda, if at all. TheCall announced it was closing sometime in 2018, according to the Wayback Machine.\nA 2012 investigation from the Atlantic found that, in 2008, the National Christian Foundation gave money to Ed Silvoso, a minister who founded a fundamentalist group called Harvest Evangelism, to work with a Ugandan bishop advocating for legislation imposing the death penalty for gay sex.\nThe Chick-fil-A connection\nChick-fil-A did not support Uganda\u2019s anti-gay bill, and connecting the company to it requires several steps.\nMost of the company and its owners\u2019 charitable giving is conducted through two nonprofit foundations: the Chick-fil-A Foundation and the WinShape Foundation. The former was created by the company in 2012 and the latter was founded by the Cathy family 1984.\nPublic tax records show the Chick-fil-A Foundation has not contributed money to the National Christian Foundation. However, the reverse is true \u2014\u00a0the National Christian Foundation gave the Chick-fil-A Foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2014 and 2015.\nThe WinShape Foundation\u2019s tax records paint a different picture.\nWe analyzed the foundation\u2019s returns dating back to 2009, when the National Christian Foundation was donating to Engle\u2019s TheCall. We found that WinShape\u2019s contributions to the National Christian Foundation totaled $240,000 in 2009 and $247,500 in both 2010 and 2011.

Louie Gohmert discussed the coronavirus and measures he says some health care workers around the world are taking to stay safe while treating patients who have tested positive for the virus.\nGohmert, a Republican from Tyler, said he recently spoke with an Arizona-based company that is producing a powder that, when mixed with water, can kill the coronavirus on contact.\nHe said the same product, or one like it, is already in use in Germany, and he is trying to get the Arizona-based product \"fast-tracked\" in the United States.\n\"It is being used in Germany as a mist,\" he said. \"Health care workers go through a misting tent going into the hospital and it kills the coronavirus completely dead not only right then, but any time in the next 14 days that the virus touches anything that\u2019s been sprayed it is killed.\"\nThe problem with Gohmert\u2019s statement? No such product exists and nothing similar is in use in Germany.\n\"What your congressman said is absolute nonsense,\" said Dr. J\u00f6rn Wegner, a spokesman for Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft, or the German Hospital Association. \"There are no such tents and there\u2019s no powder or magical cure.\"\nGohmert\u2019s office did not return a request for more information about his statement, including what substance constitutes this powder and the name of the company in Arizona that he says is working on such a product.\nIt is possible Gohmert was thinking of recent news reports of sterilization stations in use in China \u2014 images show individuals being sprayed with mist as they walk through a tunnel \u2014 but experts said the bleach-type sprays being used at these stations are likely not effective against the coronavirus.\nProtective measures in Germany\nA search of top news publications in Germany and the United States revealed no recent articles published about a powder or disinfectant being used on hospital employees that kills the virus on contact and for 14 days after the fact.\nWhile Germany has been hit hard by the coronavirus, it is also among the countries with the lowest fatality rate.\nNews outlets have explored why Germany has reported such a low fatality rate, including analyzing how its hospitals are handling the outbreak. But those reports have not mentioned a substance like the one Gohmert described.\nIn Germany, health authorities at the state level are responsible for hospital planning and operation while the Federal Ministry of Health\u00a0 drafts overarching policies and regulations.\nSebastian G\u00fclde, spokesman for the Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Gesundheit, or Federal Ministry of Health, said he is aware of some hospitals that are using tents for screening for symptoms of the virus, but he did not have knowledge of a product like the one Gohmert described.\n\"I did not hear of a disinfecting agent that keeps pathogens away for two weeks,\" G\u00fclde said.\nG\u00fclde directed PolitiFact\u2019s inquiry to the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Krankenhaushygiene, the German Society of Hospital Hygiene, which issues recommendations on best practices for hospital hygiene and health.\nThomas Ruttkowski, the organization\u2019s spokesman, said there is no product like the one Gohmert described.\n\"I\u2019m sorry, but we did not heard about that magic powder,\" he said in an email. \"Thank you for your mail. \u2026 Finally, something to laugh about.\"\nProtecting against the virus\nDuring the interview, Gohmert mentioned that a company in Arizona was developing a similar product, but his team did not return a request for more information about the company or its product.\nA thorough web search did not return results for news stories or company websites for a business that may be working on producing this kind of powder-like product that can kill the coronavirus on contact.\nCurrently, no disinfectant of this nature has been highlighted by the Environmental Protective Agency as being effective for use against SARS-CoV-2\u00a0 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19).\nNone of these products registered with the EPA are approved for use on people. They are strictly surface disinfectants.\nAmy Cross, project coordinator at the National Pesticide Information Center, said she is not aware of a product on the list of EPA-regulated surface disinfectants that meets the description Gohmert offered.\nThere are some products that are powder-based and can be combined with water and used in a liquid form, Cross said. But like all of the disinfectants on the list, the product is a liquid and has a set contact time \u2014 the amount of time a surface needs to stay wet with a product for it to be effective.\nCross said this time varies by product, ranging from 15 seconds to 15 minutes.\n\"The idea that it would have residual activity after the surface is no longer wet to kill that virus is incredibly surprising to me, because I haven\u2019t found any other products that have those similar claims,\" she said of the powder Gohmert described.\nWhen reached for comment, a World Health Organization spokesperson pointed to the group\u2019s guidelines for \"infection prevention and control\" geared towards health care workers treating individuals who are likely infected with the coronavirus.\nThe guidelines do not make mention of a disinfectant like the one Gohmert mentioned. They emphasize the need for workers to use personal protective equipment when necessary and practice rigorous hand hygiene.\nThe WHO guidelines also emphasize the importance of \"environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures\" and state that washing surfaces with \"water and detergent and applying commonly used hospital-level disinfectants (such as sodium hypochlorite) are effective and sufficient procedures.\"\nWegner of the German Hospital Association echoed these recommendations.\n\"The only protection against the virus are personal protection equipment \u2013 masks, disposable coats and gloves \u2013 and proper hygiene,\" he said.","cleaned_claim":"A powder has been developed that, when mixed with water, is being used in Germany as a mist.

Chip Roy, a Republican from Austin, discussed the status of coronavirus in the state and spoke about a number of policies under consideration \u2014 including whether mail-in voting should be expanded for the general election in November.\nCiting concerns about voter fraud, Roy said it doesn\u2019t make sense to \"flip our system on its head and convert to all, or significant, mail voting\" or online voting.\nInstead, he said state officials should be able to find a way to make in-person voting safe by the time the November election rolls around. He pointed to Wisconsin as evidence that in-person voting could be safe, even during a pandemic.\nWisconsin\u2019s presidential primary election was held April 7, after a legal fight and much public debate about whether it was safe for voters to go to the polls in the middle of the pandemic.\n\"If you look at Wisconsin, I\u2019ve yet to see a spike or anything (in coronavirus cases) that anybody has said was statistically significant related to the fact that they had voting,\" Roy said.\nEvan Smith, chief executive officer of the Texas Tribune, interjected and said: \"In fact, the Wisconsin Health Department said that 36 people at least are believed to have gotten the virus as a consequence of voting in person. There has been reporting on this.\"\nRoy replied: \"I\u2019ve looked at that report and I\u2019ve looked at studies and I\u2019ve not seen any significant study that has shown a spike as a result of their election. By the way, that was in the heat of the initial outbreak a few weeks ago. What we\u2019re talking about is laying out a system where this can work, and we\u2019ve got until November to do it.\"\nPolitiFact Wisconsin has examined other claims related to its election, but is it true that there was no statistically significant spike in COVID-19 cases as a result of the election?\nRoy\u2019s office did not return a request for comment.\nTracking cases\nIn the weeks since April 7, health experts in Wisconsin have attempted to track the number of COVID-19 cases with links to the election.\nThe tally includes people who tested positive for COVID-19 after April 9 who reported having voted in person or who worked at the polls on the day of the election. The tally does not include people who voted or worked the polls but started to display symptoms after April 21.\nAs of May 7, Wisconsin had identified 67 people who fit this criteria, according to Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.\nBut that does not guarantee that these individuals contracted the virus while voting, a point state health officials have emphasized.\nIn an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (a PolitiFact Wisconsin partner), Darren Rausch, lead for the Milwaukee County COVID-19 Epidemiology Intel Team, said the election\u2019s timing makes it difficult to link cases to the voting.\n\"What complicated our analysis is also included in this time frame is both the Easter and Passover holiday weekends, and both of those included the opportunity for significant breaches of the safer-at-home order,\" he said. \"So that was complicating our work from the beginning.\"\nIn total, Wisconsin had reported 8,901 cumulative positive coronavirus tests on May 6, when Roy made this statement. That total includes 335 new cases recorded that day.\nOn election day, an estimated 413,000 people voted in person across Wisconsin, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Experts said a surge tied to the election would have appeared in statewide data at the end of April, given the incubation period of the coronavirus. But, no surge appeared.\nOne factor could be mitigation efforts in place across the state at the time, as cellphone data analyzed by researchers showed residents complying with stay-at-home orders in the week after the election.\nSince then, the number of cases linked to the election increased from about 40 to 67.\nDr. Ryan Westergaard, the chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said there is reason to believe the election did expose some individuals to the virus, but there is not enough data to point towards a statewide trend.\n\"With the data we have, we can't prove an association,\" Westergaard said in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"It would be speculative to say that was definitely the cause without really investigating closely and being clear that somebody really had no other potential exposure to infected people. I don\u2019t think we have the resources to really do that to know definitely.\"\nPublic figures have repeatedly tried to connect trends in coronavirus cases in Wisconsin with the election, but other factors have impacted the data. On April 22, the state saw a spike in cases, but the spike was tied to outbreaks at meatpacking plants in the state \u2014\u00a0not the election.\nA different spike, identified earlier in April, was due to a change in the number of tests being administered. Facebook posts suggested that the state was seeing more cases, but this was due to a dip in the number of tests administered and a subsequent increase in testing.","cleaned_claim":"Wisconsin has not had a spike in coronavirus cases that was statistically significant related to the fact that they had voting.","ambiguity_score":0.479760021,"paraphrases":[["Although Wisconsin did not experience a significant spike in coronavirus cases related to voting, this does not mean that the state is in the clear.",0.0183024034],["There has been no significant spike in coronavirus cases in Wisconsin related to voting.",0.0293247756],["Despite holding elections, Wisconsin has not experienced a significant spike in coronavirus cases.",0.479760021],["There has been no significant spike in coronavirus cases in Wisconsin in relation to the fact that they had voting.",0.0326175541],["There has been no significant increase in coronavirus cases in Wisconsin related to in-person voting.",0.4085830152]]}

Similar posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, according to CrowdTangle, an audience metrics tool.\n(Screenshot from Facebook)\nWe\u2019ve previously fact-checked inaccurate claims about face mask rules and concealed-weapon laws, so we wanted to investigate this Facebook post.\nThere is no federal law that bans carrying a concealed weapon while wearing a mask. The Facebook post comes from a blog post about an Illinois statute that prohibits carrying a firearm while wearing a face covering. But the Illinois State Police said that law does not apply to lawful concealed-weapon permit holders who abide by the state's COVID-19 mask requirements.\nThe claim stems from an April 25 article on a website called Illinois Leaks.\nIllinois Leaks is run by the Edgar County Watchdogs, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization that aims to expose government corruption and waste. The article focuses on Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker\u2019s April 30 executive order, which required the public to wear face coverings in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order went into effect May 1.\nIllinois Leaks wrote that the order either \"strips a gun owner of his rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask, or makes them a criminal if they exercise their gun rights while complying with the executive order to wear a mask.\"\nIt does neither of those things.\nThe source of the Illinois Leaks article is a state statute that says it\u2019s illegal for someone to carry a gun when \"hooded, robed or masked in such manner as to conceal his or her identity.\" Violating that law is punishable by a class four felony, which comes with a maximum prison sentence of three years, or six years for an extended term.\nOn its face, the article seems to have a point about the letter of the law and Pritzker\u2019s executive order. But the spirit of those rules paints a different picture.\nA statement published in late April by the Illinois State Police says the executive order \"was not intended to negatively impact permit holders under the Illinois Concealed Carry Act while legally carrying firearms.\"\n\"The executive order does not require or suggest that law enforcement should arrest or criminally charge conceal carry license permit holders for wearing protective masks while in public as long as they are complying with the other provisions of the Illinois Concealed Carry Act and are not committing any other violations of Illinois law,\" the state police said.\nThe Illinois attorney general\u2019s office told us that it would be up to the discretion of local prosecutors whether to bring charges against someone for violating the statute. The state police said in its statement that it expects police officers \"will use appropriate judgment\" and state\u2019s attorneys \"will likewise exercise sound prosecutorial discretion.\"\nRELATED:\u00a0No, wearing a mask doesn\u2019t void concealed-carry permit\nAccording to some tallies, about 15 states, as well as cities and counties, have anti-mask laws on the books that pre-date the coronavirus pandemic. Some states, especially those in the South, enacted those laws around the turn of the century to combat the Ku Klux Klan, whose members don white hoods.\nOne of those laws is in North Carolina. It prohibits people from covering their faces in public, but that law is currently suspended and does not mention firearms at all. We couldn\u2019t find any other state where wearing a protective mask while carrying a concealed weapon is currently banned.","cleaned_claim":"People carrying guns can\u2019t wear face masks to protect against the coronavirus because it\u2019s a class 4 felony.","ambiguity_score":0.0274042767,"paraphrases":[["It is a class 4 felony for people to wear face masks while carrying guns in order to protect themselves from the coronavirus.",0.0243813954],["It is a class 4 felony to wear a face mask while carrying a gun.",0.0274042767],["People who are carrying guns are not allowed to wear face masks to protect themselves from the coronavirus, because doing so would be a class 4 felony.",0.0102825742],["It is a class 4 felony to wear a face mask while carrying a gun in order to protect oneself from the coronavirus.",0.017814666]]}

In Minneapolis, protesters surrounded a police station May 28, entered it and set fires inside. There was looting, vandalism and other fires in the city.\nTrump vowed the federal government was ready to step in.\n\"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen,\" Trump tweeted at about 1 a.m. May 29. \"Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"\nRELATED: From Miami '67 to Donald Trump 2020: The history of 'when the looting starts, the shooting starts'\nOn the afternoon of May 29, the Black Lives Matter protest movement arrived in Washington, D.C. About 1,000 people gathered in a park across the street from the White House. The confrontation between police and protesters grew more tense. At about 3 a.m., a line of officers in riot gear with shields advanced and deployed chemical irritants to disperse the crowd.\nThe next day, police in full riot gear, again facing a line of protestors \u2014 some throwing water bottles and eggs \u2014 charged and broke up the group. Video from a local news reporter captured the clash.\nThere are iconic images that took place after the initial clashes. Police on horseback and officers firing pepper balls charged through peaceful protesters. Their goal \u2014\u00a0move them away from a church where Trump was scheduled to have his picture taken holding up a Bible. Lines of National Guard troops stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.\nBut even from the first encounters, the use of riot gear and shields against Black Lives Matter protesters stands in sharp contrast to the security line that met the Trump supporters at the Capitol Jan. 6.\nWhen marchers walked up to a portable metal barricade on the Capitol grounds, they saw a handful of officers in their regular uniforms standing on the other side. The marchers and officers struggled over control of the barricade. The Trump supporters overwhelmed the police.\nSoon after, a line of police were tussling with Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol. Rioters shoved police officers, spraying chemical irritants and hitting them with lead pipes. Police deployed flash bangs and pepper spray in an attempt to ward off the crowd.\nA couple of hours after rioters breached the Capitol\u2019s first line of defense, police reinforcements began to arrive. Many wore riot gear. They used tear gas to disperse the rioters. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser imposed a 6 p.m. curfew.\nAfter curfew, law enforcement officers clad in body armor began to use aggressive tactics similar to their treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters, advancing on rioters and whacking them with batons.\nResponse to advance warnings\nWhile police forces prepared for the worst with the Black Lives Matter protests, the people in charge of protecting the Capitol failed to anticipate the aggression of the Trump supporters.\nRep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, head of the House committee that controls the Capitol Police budget, said that a week before the march, the Capitol Police assured him that everything was under control. Ryan said he was told they expected a \"pretty vanilla\" protest.\n\"There wasn't going to be any kind of violence anticipated,\" Ryan said. \"Maybe some dust-ups. Maybe issues around people trying to get guns into the District of Columbia, where they have very strict gun laws, but absolutely nothing like this.\"\nThe people who study crowds and police say there was ample reason to plan for a much more aggressive group.\n\"There was clear intelligence about where this was headed,\" said Ed Maguire, Arizona State University criminologist. \"All you had to do is go on Parler (the alt-right social media platform) for 10 minutes. I was on the night before. They were talking about violence. This is open source material, and the police would have had more.\"\nJust a month earlier, a Dec. 12 Trump rally had attracted members of the Proud Boys, a violence-prone group that showed up again on Jan. 6. In December, they were involved in street fights that led to multiple stabbings. Bowser urged residents to stay home and avoid any confrontation with people coming to the rally.\nThe night before the assault on the Capitol, members of the Proud Boys and a militia group called the Three Percenters were in Washington wearing body armor and helmets, with some carrying clubs.","cleaned_claim":"Summer protesters outside the White House were met with tear gas, rubber bullets, a full militarized response.

States currently without one would have to appoint a 15-member panel composed of equal numbers of Democrats, Republicans and independents. The law also says, broadly, that lines should not be drawn for partisan gain and that communities, if possible, should not be divided.\nHowever, the bill says states \u2014 not the federal government \u2014 would choose the commissioners and equip them for the task. These panels would not become the federal government\u2019s \"own committees\" handling redistricting.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.","full_article":"An expansive voting rights bill known as H.R. 1 includes provisions on voter registration procedures, mail balloting, voter ID laws and campaign finance. One less-discussed, but far-reaching aspect of the law surrounds congressional redistricting \u2014 the process by which states redraw district lines for their House delegation every 10 years after the census.\nThe bill has passed the House narrowly, on a near-party-line vote. It is now under consideration in the Senate.\nThe redistricting provisions seek to address longstanding complaints that state legislators \u2014 who redraw the lines in most states \u2014 have a vested interest in drawing lines that benefit their own party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\nThe bill would require all states to use a system like one used in several states already, where the final lines win approval from a cross-section of Republicans, Democrats and independents on a special commission.\nThe redistricting provisions became the focus of an attack by the conservative group Turning Point USA in a recent video shared on Instagram.\nThe video says in part, \"States have the sovereignty to redistrict their own states, to decide where their congressional districts are. H.R. 1 destroys that right and gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees to violate the states\u2019 sovereignty in drawing congressional districts. This is a federal committee you did not elect in charge of redistricting your state, your congressional district where you live.\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)\nWe took a closer look at whether H.R. 1 \"gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees\" to take over the redistricting process.\nWe found that this description is misleading.\nTurning Point USA did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\nHow would H.R. 1 reshape congressional redistricting?\nToday, nine states have independent commissions that draw congressional district lines: Arizona, Colorado, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington state. Montana also has an independent commission, but it currently has only one statewide congressional seat. Iowa, meanwhile, has a nonpartisan system that is considered similarly removed from politics.\nIn the other states, the legislature controls redistricting. Under H.R. 1, those states would need to shift the task to an independent commission. The expectation is that this switch would take place in time for the 2031 round of redistricting, said Michael Li, senior counsel at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice.\nAccording to the bill, the process would start with an existing nonpartisan state agency assembling a pool of qualified commissioners, screened for conflicts of interest. (The bill is vague about which officials would do this, but for its current commission, Arizona uses an appellate court personnel board, while California uses its state auditor's office.) The state agency would appoint six members to the commission from that pool: two from each major party and two from neither party. Then those six commissioners would appoint nine other commissioners from the pool, three from each major party and three from neither.\nThis 15-member board would scrutinize the maps and propose new lines, with their meetings and underlying data open to the public.\nA final map would have to win enough support from all three party groups.\nWhile H.R. 1 leaves the nitty gritty of line-drawing to the commission, it does spell out some principles that should be upheld. They include, \"to the extent practicable,\" keeping \"communities of interest\" \u2014 such as counties, municipalities and reservations \u2014 whole. And the bill explicitly says that the new map cannot be drawn with \"the intent or the effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring any political party.\"\nDoes H.R. 1 give the federal government \"the power to establish their own committees\" for redistricting?\nThe bill does mandate an overhaul of how redistricting is done in most states. But the video misinterprets this change.\nThe bill \"requires that the states establish their own committees,\" said David Daley, a senior fellow at FairVote, a voting-and-elections advocacy group. \"It does not give the federal government the power to establish those commissions for them.\"\nJon Eguia, a Michigan State University economist who has studied redistricting systems,\u00a0 agreed: \"I don\u2019t see the federal government establishing any committees under H.R. 1.\"\n\"You can say that H.R. 1 is bossy toward states, or that it takes away their right to decide how to conduct elections,\" he added. \"But I think the phrase (in the video) is misleading.\"\nWould the change in H.R. 1 \"violate the states\u2019 sovereignty in drawing congressional districts\"?\nWhether the redistricting provisions of H.R. 1 would pass constitutional muster is still an open question.\nRedistricting experts said that both supporters and opponents of the law would argue their case using the Constitution\u2019s Elections Clause. That clause says:\n\"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\"\nCritics of the bill will point to the phrase, \"shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof,\" arguing that the power rests with legislatures, rather than Congress. Meanwhile, supporters will point to the next phase, \"but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations,\" arguing that this gives Congress the upper hand on this issue.\n\"The founders gave Congress this power for exactly this reason, concerned that states might develop unfair election processes,\" Daley said.\nStates might argue that requiring them to use commissions is an \"unconstitutional form of \u2018commandeering\u2019 of state government to serve a federal interest,\" Li said, \"but states made that same argument about the National Voter Registration Act, which was also enacted under the Elections Clause, and courts rejected it.\"\nLi also pointed to the 2019 Supreme Court case Rucho v. Common Cause, in which Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for a 5-4 majority, highlighted Congress\u2019 power under the Elections Clause to overrule partisan gerrymanders.\nSpecifically citing the precursor to H.R. 1, which was then pending in Congress, Roberts wrote that \"the Framers gave Congress the power to do something about partisan gerrymandering in the Elections Clause. \u2026 The avenue for reform established by the Framers, and used by Congress in the past, remains open.\"\nToday, the Supreme Court has one more conservative member, however, so critics of H.R. 1 would likely sue if the bill passes.","cleaned_claim":"HR 1 gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees to take over the redistricting process.","ambiguity_score":0.1585881561,"paraphrases":[["The federal government would be able to establish committees to handle redistricting instead of state governments.",0.0829528794],["HR 1 would allow the federal government to create its own committees to handle redistricting instead of leaving it up to the states.",0.0363349915],["The HR 1 bill would allow the federal government to create its own committees to handle redistricting instead of leaving it up to the states.",0.036047738],["HR 1 would give the federal government the power to establish its own committees to take over the redistricting process.",0.1585881561],["The HR 1 bill gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees to take over the redistricting process.

At the eulogy for John Lewis, the civil rights activist and congressman from Georgia who died in 2020, Obama called the filibuster a \"Jim Crow relic.\"\nIn the transcript of the interview with Klein, this passage about the filibuster included a link to a Washington Post analysis of the differences between population and representation in the Senate. However, the Post article doesn\u2019t precisely support what Obama said.\nWe reached out to Obama\u2019s post-presidential press office but did not hear back. Instead, we crunched the numbers from the 2020 Census and concluded that Obama\u2019s overall point had merit but that he misstated the details.\nIn particular, Obama said that states with a small percentage of the population could control \"the majority of Senate seats.\" Given today\u2019s partisan tendencies in each state, controlling an actual majority of seats would not be feasible for that small a percentage. However, a small percentage of the population could control enough seats to successfully wield the filibuster, which effectively gives them control over whether a majority can pass legislation.\nWhat the Post article said\nThe Constitution gives each state two senators, regardless of population, so Wyoming and Vermont have the same representation in the chamber as California and Texas, which have more than 30 times as many people.\nThe Post article cited in the transcript was headlined, \"By 2040, two-thirds of Americans will be represented by 30% of the Senate.\" That\u2019s 20 years in the future, but the article goes on to note that even today, the largest 15 states have 66% of the nation\u2019s population, but just 30 seats in the Senate.\nWhile the article\u2019s conclusion is generally consistent with Obama\u2019s point, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the filibuster or the 60-vote threshold to end one. Rather, the article looked at representation throughout the entire chamber.\nMore importantly, the headline finding from the article is purely numerical, and ignores which party currently holds the smallest states\u2019 Senate seats. In reality, those 35 smaller states have selected a mix of Republican and Democratic senators, so these states would not be likely to form a unified coalition.\nTaking into account party affiliation\nBut there are ways to look at the question of whether senators from a bloc of smaller states could effectively use the filibuster to steer the Senate for one party. One way is to ask: What is the smallest share of the U.S. population whose senators could block legislation by mounting a successful filibuster, once you factor in the prevailing party affiliation?\nFor this analysis, we used the current partisan breakdown of the Senate. The results could change if seats flip in the next election, or if partisan trends in some states evolve.\nWe looked at the smallest 21 states that currently have two senators from the same party \u2014 21 because that\u2019s the minimum number of states that would allow one party to prevail in a filibuster, and the same party because in the six states with mixed delegations, the senators\u2019 votes would likely cancel each other out. (We counted the Senate\u2019s two independent members, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Democrats, since they caucus with the Democrats.)\nThe 21 smallest states that have two Republican senators account for 29% of the U.S. population. So, by themselves, these states could muster 42 votes to sustain a filibuster, thereby overruling the 71% of the population represented by the other 58 senators.\nThe 21 smallest states with two Democratic senators account for 39% of the U.S. population, meaning that Democrats from these states could mount a filibuster that thwarts senators representing the remaining 61% of the population.\nSo Obama\u2019s remark is a reasonable assessment of how much muscle a fraction of states can flex in order to block legislation in the Senate.\nHow much population is needed to control a majority of Senate seats?\nBut Obama\u2019s claim that \"30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats\" overreaches. In the Senate\u2019s current makeup, 29% to 39% of the population could control 42 seats \u2014 but not a majority of seats in the 100-seat chamber.\nIn reality, neither party today can muster an actual majority,\u00a051 seats,\u00a0using just states that have unified partisan control of their Senate delegation.\nAdding Texas and California to the previous tally, the 22 states that currently have two Republican senators represent 38% of the population, and the 22 states with two Democratic senators represent 51% of the population. (The other six states have mixed representation.)\nThese groupings of states produce only 44 seats for either party \u2014 not a majority.\nIn the big picture, however, Obama has a legitimate point, said Josh Ryan, a Utah State University political scientist and specialist in Congress.\n\"Essentially a very small population of the country gets to veto legislation preferred by a large majority,\" Ryan said. \"They don't get to control the Senate, but they get to control what passes the Senate.\"","cleaned_claim":"The filibuster, if it does not get reformed, still means that maybe 30% of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats.","ambiguity_score":0.3958394825,"paraphrases":[["The filibuster, if not reformed, means that a minority of the population potentially controls the majority of Senate seats.",0.3958394825],["The filibuster, if it is not reformed, means that a potentially small minority of the population could control the majority of Senate seats.",0.1785650849],["The filibuster, if not reformed, still gives a minority of the population potential control over the majority of Senate seats.",0.2330899686],["The filibuster, if it is not reformed, could still mean that a minority of the population could control the majority of Senate seats.",0.0840735808],["If the filibuster is not reformed, it still means that a small minority of the population could potentially control the majority of Senate seats.",0.1564339995]]}

In fact, she\u2019s skeptical that pieces of the plane exist at all.\nOn Facebook, Mayfield recently posted a link to an obscure website promoting the idea that the towers in New York City may have fallen on Sept. 11, 2001, for some reason other than being struck by airplanes.\n\"I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane that opened the doors for US Citizens to loose all privacy rights (from the conspiracy theorist in me),\" she posted.\nMayfield later apologized for posting comments that caused \"hurt and pain,\" but has declined to acknowledge that planes were responsible for the collapse of the Twin Towers.\nShe appeared on the WCNC show \"Flashpoint\" to discuss the post.

News cameras also captured footage of the second plane hitting the south tower.\nLarge pieces of the airplanes were found around Ground Zero, as documented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002. A piece \u2013 part of a plane wing \u2013 was found nearby in 2013.

But the fuel doesn\u2019t need to melt the beams in order to damage their structural integrity.\nFurthermore, the World Trade Center was built with a load-bearing core in its center (as opposed to concrete columns). But that center, the Washington Post pointed out, was surrounded by a \"thin exterior shell \u2014 a density of eight to nine pounds per cubic foot.

Bernie Sanders.\nGiven their long records of service in Congress, they challenged each other\u2019s voting history on critical bills during the March 15 debate in Washington, D.C.\nBiden claimed that Sanders voted against an immigration bill that, if it had passed, would have granted citizenship to 6 million people living in the country illegally. Sanders fought back, saying Biden was talking about a 2007 bill that actually had strong opposition from immigrant rights advocates and another key figure: Barack Obama.\n\"That bill was opposed by (the League of United Latin American Citizens), the largest Latino organization in America. The Southern Poverty Law Center called its guest-worker programs akin to slavery,\" Sanders said. \"There wasn't really a vote on the bill. It was killed because there was a vote on the Dorgan amendment, I think it was 49-48. And you know who voted with me on that one, Joe? Barack Obama. He understood that that proposal was a bad idea. We don't need slavery in America where workers, guest-workers are forced to stay with their employers.\"\nWe wanted to know if Sanders was right about opposition to the bill and Obama\u2019s alignment on this issue. He\u2019s right about groups rejecting the bill and the temporary worker program, but his statement leaves out key details about how he and Obama voted.\nOverview of the 2007 legislation\nIn mid 2007, Congress deliberated an overhaul of the immigration system that faced opposition from members of both parties. Some Republicans opposed a plan that they said offered amnesty to immigrants. Some Democrats also opposed it, siding with allies in organized labor who were concerned about a provision allowing more non-U.S. citizens to come to the United States to work.\nA proposed compromise measure provided a path to citizenship for workers illegally in the country, increased border security, strengthened\u00a0 employment law enforcement, and provided more visas for temporary workers.\nOn June 6, 2007, then-Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., offered what became known as the Dorgan Amendment and which Sanders referenced during the debate. The amendment sought to end a temporary worker program after five years. Dorgan argued it would open the door to more cheap labor and negatively impact American workers. The amendment passed 49-48.\nSanders voted for it, and he\u2019s right that Obama also voted for it. However, Sanders didn\u2019t mention that Biden, then also a senator, joined Obama and Sanders in voting in favor of the Dorgan Amendment. Sanders made it sound as if only himself and Obama were on the same side of the issue.\nSupporters of the broader immigration bill viewed the Dorgan Amendment as a \"deal-breaker.\" The bill died soon after, failing to secure enough votes on three separate motions to end debate, a move that would have allowed the bill to go forward. Obama and Biden voted in favor of ending the debate, while Sanders voted against ending debate each of the three times.\nDavid Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Sanders\u2019 actions were somewhat perplexing: \"The guest worker program he opposed was gutted, yet Sanders still voted to deny the amended bill a final vote, while Biden and Obama voted to proceed to a final vote. But if the Dorgan Amendment fixed the problem Sanders wanted fixed \u2014 as he says \u2014 he still hasn\u2019t explained why he voted to stop the bill from passing.\"\nOpposition to the bill from immigrant rights groups\nThe Sanders campaign sent PolitiFact a link to a May 2007 post from the League of United Latin American Citizens, which said its national board of directors unanimously opposed the Senate compromise bill.\nIn its form, the temporary worker program \"would create a new underclass of easily exploited workers who would be forbidden from realizing the American Dream,\" the group said.\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, the league said it did not support the bill then \"because the guest worker provision created a third-class citizenship.\"\nWhat about the Southern Poverty Law Center, did it say that guestworker programs were \"akin to slavery,\" as Sanders claimed?\nThe center in 2007 published a report titled, \"Close to slavery: Guestworker Programs in the United States.\" Its intent was to flag issues within an existing guestworker program as Congress considered similar proposals.\nThe report was highly critical of the way employees in the existing program were being treated, saying workers were bound to the employers who \"import\" them and lacked access to legal resources. It also said such employees were routinely cheated out of wages, forced to live in squalid conditions, and \"held virtually captive by employers or labor brokers who seize their documents.\"\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center\u00a0 said that the guestworker program was \"inherently abusive\" and if allowed to continue, should be \"completely overhauled.\"","cleaned_claim":"A 2007 immigration bill was opposed by the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest Latino organization in America.

We rate the statement Pants on Fire.","full_article":"President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to the Sheffer Corp. near Cincinnati was billed as a chance to discuss the recently enacted tax law. While Trump did discuss the tax law, most coverage of the speech led with a digression in which Trump accused Democrats of treason.\nIt came as Trump was touting a drop in African-American unemployment, as he had done on several occasions previously. He knocked Democrats for their failure to applaud when he mentioned this during his State of the Union address.\n\"You\u2019re up there, you\u2019ve got half the room going totally crazy, wild \u2014 they loved everything, they want to do something great for our country,\" Trump said on Feb. 5. \"And you have the other side, even on positive news \u2014 really positive news, like that \u2014 they were like death and un-American. \u00a0Un-American. Somebody said, \u2018treasonous.\u2019 I mean, yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn\u2019t seem to love our country very much.\"\nThere\u2019s actually a very good reason why not: The Constitution.\n\"It was a profoundly stupid and ignorant statement,\" said Carlton F.W. Larson, a law professor at the the University of California-Davis who is writing a book about treason and the American Revolution. \"There are occasional hard cases where it is debatable whether something constitutes treason. But this is not one of them.\"\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told NBC News the following day that Trump had been \"tongue in cheek,\" and in the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said,\u00a0\"The president was clearly joking with his comments.\"\nStill, we\u2019ve decided to fact-check Trump\u2019s statement for two reasons. First, the long lead-up to the \"treason\" comment came off as entirely serious, and while the reference to \"treason\" itself was uttered in a flip manner, it fell short of being clearly a joke. (Watch the video and judge for yourself here.)\nSecond, the Constitution is very clear when it comes to the definition of treason.\nThe Constitution -- which mentions very few crimes specifically -- defines treason this way:\n\"Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.\n\"The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.\"\nThis is a narrow definition. On the most basic level, treason has to occur in wartime, or during an armed rebellion against the government.\nWith the possible exception of an American \"levying war\" against U.S. troops in a place like Afghanistan, \"the biggest-picture takeaway is that there is no treason occurring on any side now,\" said Jed Shugerman, a legal historian at Fordham Law School.\nIndeed, Shugerman has previously cautioned those on the left who would label members of Trump\u2019s circle as treasonous for allegedly cooperating with Russia during the 2016 election. The most fundamental reason why the word \"treason\" would be inaccurate in such cases, Shugerman and others argue, is that the United States is not at war with Russia.\n\"We are not at war with Russia under any fair understanding of the word,\" he said. Shugerman added that even a notion like \"cyberwar\" with Russia is a metaphor for war rather than an actual deadly conflict, unless that cyberwar were to escalate to, say, hacking into nuclear power plants with the intent of exploding them.\nCalling U.S.-Russia relations \"war\" is no more accurate than calling the Super Bowl \"war\" just because the players talk about battle plans and how to attack their enemy, he said.\nBecause the definition of treason is so narrow, charges have only been brought a few dozen times in the country\u2019s history, and none, apparently, since the end of World War II, which -- perhaps not coincidentally -- was the last officially declared war.\nA rendering of the Whiskey Rebellion. (Wikimedia commons)\nCharges of treason have been prosecuted in relation to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794; against Aaron Burr (who was acquitted); Thomas W. Dorr, who set up a parallel government of Rhode Island in the 1840s (he was convicted but later pardoned); and a number of cases related to slavery and the Civil War.\nThere was a flurry of treason cases during and after World War II, including the poet Ezra Pound for pro-Axis propaganda (he was hospitalized for insanity) and the broadcast propagandists known as Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally (both of whom served prison time).\nThe rarity of treason charges can also be seen in the examples of actions that never drew a treason charge.\nWhen Eugene V. Debs was prosecuted for encouraging draft avoidance during World War I, he was charged with sedition, not treason. During the Cold War, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted of espionage charges, not treason. (Espionage does not have to occur during wartime, or even against an enemy.) And Jane Fonda was never charged with treason for allegations of anti-Americanism when she consorted with the North Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.\nLegal scholars we contacted unanimously said Trump\u2019s words were ill-conceived.\n\"It\u2019s not only legally frivolous and offensive to suggest that an act of political protest as simple as not clapping isn\u2019t treason, but it\u2019s wholly ignorant of why the Constitution has a treason clause in the first place \u2014 to prevent what was a common practice in England at the time, in which the government labeled its political opponents as \u2018traitors\u2019 and used that as an excuse to throw them in jail,\" said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas.\n\"Being rude and partisan does not come close to the constitutional definition of treason,\" agreed Robert F. Turner, a fellow at the Center for National Security Law at the University of Virginia.\nMichael C.H. McDaniel, the director of Homeland Security Law Programs at Western Michigan University, said there could hardly be a clearer example of protected political speech than the one Trump decided to label treasonous.\n\"Expressing partisan disagreement with the president is not treason -- in fact, it is political speech, the core speech to which the First Amendment is protecting from the Federal government,\" he said.","cleaned_claim":"At the State of the Union address, Democrats, even on positive news \u2026 were like death and un-American.

This metadata can be \"collected\" -- as Udall phrased it -- though it\u2019s important to note that this data cannot be utilized directly in an investigation until a more stringent legal standard is met.\nMeanwhile, common sense tells us that millions of Americans who are having their metadata collected are not involved in terrorism, further bolstering Udall\u2019s claim.\nBecause this program was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, it is, in a de facto sense, legal. That doesn\u2019t mean the program wouldn\u2019t be vulnerable to court challenges in the future, but until that happens, we rate the statement True.","full_article":"While most Americans seem ready to support intelligence agencies casting a wide net against terrorists, they have some concerns about the scope of domestic surveillance. Congress began hearings on the surveillance of phone calls and Internet traffic that became public last week.\nOn June 9, 2013, ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos aired footage of comments from Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. In a floor speech roughly two years ago, Udall urged his colleagues to narrow the reach of the USA Patriot Act, one of the key legal tools that allow the United States to gather intelligence.\nUdall had been briefed on the program that stored data on millions of phone calls made in the United States, but secrecy rules prohibited him from offering details. Instead, he warned broadly that the intelligence community \"can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.\"\nUdall\u2019s office affirmed that they still reflect the senator\u2019s position. So we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally \"collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.\"\nUdall cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act as the relevant part of the law. This provision was reportedly the one used by the government to obtain a broad sweep of \"metadata\" -- information on phone numbers, call durations and other information short of the actual conversations -- from Verizon customers.\nSection 215 allows the FBI to require \"the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism.\"\nHowever, the government faces some limits. The FBI must demonstrate to a special court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things being sought are relevant to an investigation involving terrorism. Approval must be renewed every three months. The law also requires steps to limit access to information beyond the scope of the investigation.\nAfter the Guardian published its article on the gathering of millions of phone records from Verizon customers, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, addressed the \"business records\" provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nClapper said the \"program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone\u2019s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber. The only type of information acquired under the court\u2019s order is telephony metadata, such as telephone numbers dialed and length of calls,\" Clapper said in a written statement.\nGen. Keith Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency, acknowledged in a Senate hearing on June 12 that the NSA has collected millions of records under section 215.\nIn short, the program that obtained the data on Verizon customers was deemed legal by the FISA court, and it produced what the government considered \"business records\" -- specifically, metadata. Information on millions of Americans was accessed, almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism.\nUdall\u2019s claim appears accurate. Congress wrote the law and key lawmakers were kept apprised of the program; the FISA court approved it, apparently on multiple occasions.\nFormer Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, an Intelligence Committee chairman until 2005, said the ongoing activity speaks to the soundness of its legal footing.\n\"It is being done,\" Graham said. \"Given the fact that it has not been successfully challenged in the courts, that would suggest that it is within the agency\u2019s authority to do so.\"\nSteve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law, concurred that the law seems to be on the government\u2019s side.\n\"Section 215 of the Patriot Act only requires that the data be \u2018relevant\u2019 to a national security\/terrorism investigation, not that the individual whose data is seized have such a connection,\" Vladeck said.\nStill, we\u2019ll point out a few things.\nFirst, just because the government is doing it and a court is approving it doesn\u2019t mean that the metadata-collection program will be upheld as constitutional indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union has already begun to challenge the program, for instance.\nAnd the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a group focused on the intersection of technology and personal liberties, charged in a letter to Congress that the FISA court had overstepped its authority. The group said the government had failed to provide \"reasonable grounds\" for the collection of millions of Verizon telephone records.\nSecond, there\u2019s a distinction between collecting data and sifting through it. While the government has been storing phone call information in a giant database, it cannot legally access that information willy-nilly. Before it can drill down into actual phone calls, it has to meet a higher legal standard: The government must convince the court that it has a clear and reasonable suspicion that the calls are relevant to terrorist activity. Supporters of the program including the White House and lawmakers cite the need to get specific permission for database queries as an essential protection of individual privacy.","cleaned_claim":"Currently, the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.","ambiguity_score":0.0537570342,"paraphrases":[["The intelligence community can currently collect business records on law-abiding Americans who are not connected to terrorism.",0.008064555],["The intelligence community is able to collect data on law-abiding citizens who are not associated with terrorism.",0.0537570342],["The intelligence community can currently collect business records on Americans who are not connected to terrorism.",0.0107017215],["At present, the intelligence community can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism.",0.0075078551]]}

The source of her claim uses an earlier version of Rubio\u2019s plan in its analysis,  and she said $3 million when she should have said $3.3 million. But the thrust of her statement is sound. An analysis of a plan extremely similar to the one put forth by Rubio would cut taxes for those making $3.3 million and more by nearly $240,000, which is more than three times the U.S. median household income of $53,046. We rate her statement MostlyTrue.","full_article":"Hillary Clinton outlined her economic vision in detail for the first time during her presidential campaign, calling for a \"growth and fairness\" economy in a speech at the New School in Manhattan on July 13, 2015.\nShe also lambasted a select group Republican presidential candidates for their purportedly out-of-touch approach toward the working class.\u00a0Among the targets were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\nClinton singled out Rubio\u2019s proposed tax plan: \"Another priority must be reforming our tax code. Now, we hear Republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform. But take a good look at their plans. Sen. Rubio's would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240,000, which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family.\"\nWe decided to fact-check the somewhat intricate claim.\nRubio\u2019s plan\nClinton\u2019s campaign directed us to a blog post from the Tax Policy Center, an independent think tank that analyzes tax policy. The article concerns Rubio\u2019s plan in general, but the pertinent part reads, \"Those in the top 0.1 percent, who make $3.3 million and up, would be in line for an average tax cut of $240,000 \u2014 a boost in after-tax income of 3.8 percent.\"\nIs $240,000 more than \"three times\" the earning power of a typical family? Her campaign pointed us to U.S. Census Bureau data that showed median household income as $53,046 for the period 2009 to 2013. So those numbers back up Clinton\u2019s statement.\nBut there is one minor complication: The article from the Tax Policy Center is based on an analysis of Utah Sen. Mike Lee\u2019s 2013 plan, not Rubio\u2019s plan (actually a joint venture with Lee) that was released in 2015 and is similar to the original Lee plan.\nGenerally speaking, the Rubio-Lee plan groups people into two income tax brackets, 15 percent or 35 percent, the higher of which would kick in at an individual income of $75,000. That\u2019s a decrease from the seven brackets currently in place. Another centerpiece of the plan is a $2,500 tax credit given to parents for each child under sixteen.\nThat\u2019s the broad outline, but the plan still lacks some details.\n\"There are critical unresolved issues that make it difficult for us to do an analysis of Rubio\u2019s current plan,\" said Howard Gleckman, resident fellow at the Tax Policy Center and author of the blog post.\nFor example, Gleckman points out that the Rubio-Lee plan never specifies exactly what would happen to a personal tax credit of $2,000, a subsidy that would be available to anybody who claimed it on their tax returns. If it were included as a refundable tax credit (meaning people could get a check back), it would have a significant impact on low-income families. As of now, their incomes would actually decrease under the Lee plan, according to the Tax Policy Center\u2019s analysis.\n\"Qualitatively, the rough sense is a very generous tax cut for high-income people,\" said Gleckman, adding, \"What we\u2019re not sure about is low-income people.\"\nSo low-income people might get some kind of tax break under Rubio\u2019s plan, or they might not.\nThe other thing to know about Clinton\u2019s statement is that the wealthy get a tax break under Rubio\u2019s plan because he wants tax reductions, and the wealthy pay the most taxes.\n\"The reason why the top is getting what\u2019s seemingly a big tax cut is that they\u2019re already taxed at a much higher rate,\" said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. Under the Rubio plan, the top tax rate would drop from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.\nPomerleau added that it\u2019s crucial to remember that the plan proposes tax cuts across all income brackets, not just the top ones, and often at higher percentages for those with lower incomes.\nPomerleau, however, did say that he found Clinton\u2019s claim plausible.","cleaned_claim":"Sen.

So are his remarks about Covid-19 antibodies and the vaccine correct?\nWhat the CDC says\nA spokesperson for the Giuliani campaign, Heather McBride, referred us to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for data regarding the effectiveness of post-Covid-19 antibodies.\nThe CDC did not respond to our messages, but the agency published a brief on April 2, in which it said that fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection and less likely to spread the coronavirus to others, though investigation into this is ongoing.\nVaccine studies show that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are effective by 90 percent or more, and the Janssen vaccine is 67 percent effective, according to the CDC and the FDA.\nIn Israel, preliminary data suggests that people who received the Pfizer vaccine and then were infected with the virus have a four-fold lower viral load that people who hadn\u2019t been vaccinated. According to the CDC, this could mean reduced transmission, \"as viral load has been identified as a key driver of transmission.\"\nA Covid-19 infection provides 83% protection against re-infection for at least five months, but it may not stop transmission, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0in England of thousands of health care workers who had been infected.\n\"The research team warned, however, that early evidence from the next stage of the study suggested that some people who are themselves protected by antibodies still carry high levels of virus and could continue to infect others,\" according to a description of the study in BMJ, which publishes medical journals.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, said in a White House briefing\u00a0\u00a0in early May that the vaccine can protect people against the virus better than natural antibodies.\n\"Vaccines are highly efficacious,\"\u00a0Fauci said. \"They are better than the traditional response you get from natural infection.\"\nDr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at University of California, San Francisco, said that immunity from the vaccine is much more robust, and it has more neutralizing antibodies than those found in people who have had the infection.\nPeople can also get infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 a second time, he said.\nPeople who have Covid-19 can transmit the virus. But there is no \"shedding\" of the virus from the vaccine, because there\u2019s no live virus in the vaccine, he said. In rare instances of \"vaccine failure,\" where people who are fully vaccinated get the virus, the virus can be transmitted.\n\"It\u2019s completely wrong on every level,\" Rutherford said of Giuliani\u2019s claim.\nPolitiFact looked at\u00a0what people who have been infected with the virus should do to protect themselves and others and found that cases of reinfection are rare. While those infected can continue shedding the virus for months after they recover, the CDC said, the amount is low enough that it is unlikely to infect others. But experts said that it\u2019s unknown how long immunity lasts.\nUSA Today fact-checked\u00a0a claim that people who have been vaccinated can shed virus particles from the vaccine on to others, and found that it was false. The three vaccines authorized for emergency use do not contain live virus. In the rare instances where vaccinated people are infected with the virus, they can transmit the virus,\u00a0according to the CDC.","cleaned_claim":"The one good thing about the antibodies if you\u2019ve had it, is it actually is even better than the vaccine, and here's why.

Ron Johnson.\nThe question was posed by host Mike Gousha at a Jan. 26, 2016 forum at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee.\nFeingold, who lost the Senate seat to Johnson in 2010, commented on Obama\u2019s record in the international arena. Then he turned to terrorism, saying \"no one in Washington has taken\" threats from foreign extremists \"as seriously as they should, and now we have to deal with it.\n\"But those who say the way to handle it is to go put 100,000 troops into the area where ISIS is -- which is what Senator Johnson wants to do -- how does this work?\"\nGousha interjected, saying Johnson has talked about only 25,000 of the troops being American, with the rest coming from an international coalition.\nFeingold responded by asserting that Johnson said there should be 100,000 troops total, including 25,000 Americans.\nSo let\u2019s sort out what Johnson has called for.\nJohnson\u2019s general position\nAs the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, Johnson is among the most aggressive voices in his party in proposing a ground invasion to drive the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria out of those two countries.\nAs early as October 2014, he called for \"boots on the ground,\" a position in line with that of most of the 2016 GOP candidates for president.\nBut Johnson has not been so clear about the numbers of troops.\nFeingold\u2019s evidence\nIn backing Feingold\u2019s claim, his campaign spokesman said the former senator was referring to comments Johnson made to Gousha during a television interview in November 2015. The campaign also cited a Huffington Post article about that interview that carried this headline: \"GOP senator wants a coalition of 100,000 troops in Iraq and Syria.\"\nBut the headline goes further than what Johnson actually said.\nHere\u2019s the exchange, with Gousha pressing Johnson for a number of American troops:\nGousha: Senator, you've said on a number of occasions that you favor U.S. troops as part of this coalition going in to these countries to help move ISIS out of its safe areas. How many American \u00a0 \u00a0 troops would you support sending overseas to accomplish this mission?\nJohnson: Well, I'm not a military expert. The model I use is what George H.W. Bush did when Saddam Hussein went into Kuwait \u2026.\nGousha: And I know you're not a military guy, but is it 10,000? Is it 20,000? Give us some idea of what you're talking about in terms of an American presence overseas.\nJohnson: I've been told by military experts that ISIS -- in terms, militarily -- is not particularly capable \u2026 militarily, it really would not be that difficult. Probably it wouldn't take anywhere near the effort that the first Gulf War did. I've been hearing 25,000 troops, a total coalition of maybe 100,000. I really don't know the exact numbers, but we have to be committed to the goal \u2026.\nSo, Johnson didn\u2019t commit to a number.\nAnd he hasn\u2019t in other interviews.\nThe previous month, Johnson said he didn\u2019t know how many U.S. troops would be needed in Syria, although that was in reference to responding to a refugee crisis.\nAnd the following month, Johnson indicated to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he was open to the numbers of American troops that were being discussed. Asked if it would take more than 20,000 to 25,000 U.S. troops to retake and hold the territory now held by ISIS, he responded: \"What\u2019s the alternative? \u2026 This is a real and growing threat.\"\nBut also in December 2015, Johnson said experts have talked about the need for 10,000 American troops, something he said he would support if Obama committed to an effective strategy.\nIn contrast, Republican U.S. senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina called specifically for 100,000 foreign troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Graham also called for 10,000 American troops.","cleaned_claim":"U.S. Sen.

Before the final version came out, she advocated more of a wait-and-see approach.\nWe rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/90008ff2-1952-4383-8676-be3604594811","full_article":"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sparred over trade deals past and present in the early moments of their first debate Monday night.\nTrump has criticized both the North American Free Trade Agreement approved under President Bill Clinton and the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nHillary Clinton, of course, was part of the Obama administration as secretary of state, and Trump said she\u2019s culpable for supporting what he said was a bad deal.\n\"You called it the gold standard,\" Trump said of the agreement, known as TPP. \"You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it\u2019s the finest deal you\u2019ve ever seen.\"\nFor her part, Clinton rebutted that she at one time thought it could be the gold standard of trade deals before it was finished negotiated, but became disenchanted once it was finalized.\n\"I did say I hoped it would be a good deal,\" she said.\nShe similarly defended herself on this point during her primary campaign against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nSo what did Clinton say about TPP?\nBack in 2012 when she was leading the State Department, Clinton was pretty effusive in her support of the deal. While in Australia, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here\u2019s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the \"gold standard\" comment in bold.\n\"So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment.\"\nAt that point, it seems clear Clinton is saying the TPP sets the gold standard. She didn\u2019t say she \"hoped\" it would.\nTrump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung pointed to this statement in Australia to defend his candidate\u2019s statement.\nOther comments around the same time echoed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet that high bar. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations \"willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP\" to join the deal.\n\"The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment,\" she said, adding that it would result in better jobs with better wages and working conditions.\nShe did not say it was \"the finest deal\" she\u2019d ever seen. But here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: \"exciting,\" \"innovative,\" \"ambitious,\" \"groundbreaking,\" \"cutting-edge,\" \"high-quality\" and \"high standard.\"\nNow, at that point, the deal was still being negotiated. And even before it was finalized, she started to temper her expectations for the deal as the campaign drew near.\nClinton spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed to this passage in\u00a0her 2014 memoir Hard Choices:\n\"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It\u2019s safe to say the TPP won\u2019t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\"\nMore recently, after the deal was finalized last year and presented for Congress to approve, Clinton changed her position and now says she opposes it.\nIn the past when asked about her wording, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill noted that the \"gold standard\" comment was made during negotiations and because they were conducted in secret, we don\u2019t know if the final deal is dramatically different than it was in 2012. It\u2019s worth pointing out, too, that as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal.","cleaned_claim":"Hillary Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the gold standard.

The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror,\" Trump wrote in a Jan. 29 statement. \"To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting.\"\nTo refresh, Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27 barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. (We go over some of the key issues in this explainer.)\nIn 2011, Obama\u2019s state department stopped processing Iraqi refugee requests for six months, though it didn\u2019t disclose the policy like Trump did, ABC reported in 2013.\nSo, are the policies similar as Trump claimed?\nIn the most superficial of ways, yes. They both limit immigration into the United States on a temporary basis. But there are two significant differences that Trump omits.\nIn 2011, there was a specific threat\nFirst, Obama\u2019s suspension was in direct response to a failed plot by Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green, Ky., to send money, explosives and weapons to al-Qaida. The two men were arrested by the FBI in May 2011 for actions committed in Iraq and trying to assist overseas terrorist groups.\nBoth had entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork. One man worked as a bombmaker in Iraq, and the FBI even matched his fingerprints to an unexploded IED discovered in 2005 in Iraq, raising questions about the thoroughness of the vetting process.\nTrump\u2019s ban, meanwhile, is more preemptive. As PolitiFact reported, no refugee or immigrant from any of the seven countries targeted by the ban has been implicated in any fatal terrorist attack in the United States, though perpetrators of at least three non-deadly cases were connected to Iran or Somalia.\nObama\u2019s order was narrower in scope\nSecond, the scope of the two policies is slightly different. Obama\u2019s 2011 order put a pause on refugee processing, whereas Trump\u2019s halt in entries applies to all non-U.S. visitors.\nIt should also be noted that Iraqi refugees were still admitted to the United States every month in 2011, though there was a significant drop after May of that year. Here\u2019s a chart with data from the state department:\nAccording to the New York Times, the Obama administration also required new background checks for visa applicants from Iraq after the Bowling Green incident. Lawmakers at a 2012 congressional hearing also indicated that the Department of Homeland Security expanded screening to the Iraqi refugees already settled in the United States.\nBut again,\u00a0these are different from a blanket ban on visitors. Obama, speaking through a spokesperson, disagreed with the comparison in a statement.\nThere are other precedents for temporary halts in immigration. A 2016 Congressional Research Service report notes that refugee admissions were also briefly suspended after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack to review the security procedures, leading to an overhaul of the system. A special subset of refugee admissions for reuniting families was suspended in 2008 in certain locations in Africa after higher rates of fraud.\nSo like Obama\u2019s 2011 suspension, both the post-9\/11 and African cases were in reaction to immediate issues and limited to refugees.\nTrump\u2019s order is broader, and his administration has provided no evidence it is in response to any particular event.\nThe seven countries on Trump\u2019s list\nWhile not necessarily part of this fact-check, Trump\u2019s suggestion that he selected the seven countries as a\u00a0continuation of Obama\u2019s policy is imprecise.\nAccording to the executive order, Trump\u2019s action applies to \"countries designated pursuant to Division O, Title II, Section 203 of the 2016 consolidated Appropriations Act.\"\nThat refers to a 2015 act, signed into law by Obama, revising the United States\u2019 visa waiver program. The visa waiver program allows citizens from 38 countries to enter the United States without a visa for up to 90 days. Under the legislation, citizens of those 38 countries who had traveled to Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan after March 2011 were no longer eligible for the visa waiver. Libya, Yemen, and Somalia were later added to the list.\nIn other words, Obama\u2019s actions dealt with people who had visited Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, not citizens of those countries, and it did not prohibit them from entering the United States.","cleaned_claim":"My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.","ambiguity_score":0.0448181741,"paraphrases":[["I have a policy similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.",0.0133416709],["My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.

The amendment reads:\n\"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\nThe basics of the impeachment process are spelled out in the Constitution. The House has \"the sole power of impeachment\" while the Senate reserves \"the sole power to try all impeachments.\" When a president is tried in the Senate, the Constitution says \"the Chief Justice shall preside\" and a two-thirds vote is required to convict and remove the president from office.\nThe specific contours of the impeachment process have taken shape over time, as we noted in our in-depth analysis of what an impeachment inquiry against Trump could look like.\nBut the Constitution says nothing about a president\u2019s term being \"nullified\" by a failed attempt at removal.

Neither have any left-wing groups or right-wing groups.\nThere was one incident in Canada, involving a rapist. In the U.S., there have been a few yet-unproven allegations.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.","full_article":"In the fight to defend Charlotte\u2019s anti-discrimination ordinance, supporters questioned claims that it would have been a threat to public safety.\nChris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said many large cities have rules similar to what Charlotte proposed, before the legislature nullified it. Equality NC has since sued North Carolina to try to overturn the law.\n\"There have not been any public safety issues in those other communities,\" Sgro said at a rally outside the legislature just days before Charlotte\u2019s bill was overturned.\nConservatives weren\u2019t swayed, though. Before Charlotte\u2019s bill was passed, and then after when it was being debated by the General Assembly and even now that is has been overturned, concerns about safety have been frequently mentioned.\nMostly, opponents said opening up women\u2019s restrooms to transgender women \u2013 people who are biologically male but identify as female \u2013 will make it easier for male sexual predators to commit crimes in bathrooms and locker rooms.\nOnline, supporters galvanized around the motto #KeepNCSafe and sent out ads that included the phrase \"don\u2019t let our girls become victims\" and \"keep children safe.\"\nN.C. GOP Executive Director Dallas Woodhouse cited \"privacy and safety concerns\" in attacking Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is running for governor as a Democrat, for not stepping in to stop Charlotte\u2019s bill on his own.\nA popular Christian author from Charlotte, Frank Turek, wrote an article about the backlash to the law that included the line, \"The danger is real from sexual predators in women\u2019s restrooms.\" On Thursday, the N.C. GOP distributed his column via email and bolded that sentence about sexual predators.\nSo who is right? The evidence is overwhelmingly on Sgro\u2019s side.\nThat\u2019s not to say that people don\u2019t have honest concerns over privacy or mental anguish. Indeed, several opponents of Charlotte\u2019s ordinance have spoken of their own experiences with sexual assault, and their fears that seeing someone with male genitalia in a women\u2019s room might trigger painful memories.\nBut still, Sgro said, Charlotte\u2019s bill would not have legalized sexual assault, harassment or voyeurism \u2013 it just would\u2019ve let transgender men and women use the bathrooms they\u2019re more comfortable in.\n\"Transgender people are not predators,\" he said.\nExamples to prove Sgro wrong?\nThe entire state of Maryland and some of the largest cities in the country, including New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Seattle and Austin, Texas, have rules banning discrimination against transgender people in public accommodation, including bathrooms. More than 200 cities and counties also ban workplace discrimination against transgender people.\nA dozen state public school systems and dozens of college campuses also have ordinances banning discrimination against transgender people, including in bathrooms.\nWe asked the N.C. GOP if they could point to anything that backs up the safety fears. They provided a link to a news story in Seattle from earlier this year, about a man who had twice gone into a women\u2019s locker room and began undressing. Seattle does allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.\nThe man didn\u2019t identify as transgender and didn\u2019t appear to present as a woman, the story said. No one called the police, and the man wasn\u2019t charged with any crime. Follow-up stories described the incident as a stunt, perhaps politically motivated.\nThe liberal group Media Matters For America has studied the bathroom issue for several years, largely under the guidance of Carlos Maza.\nMaza, a Wake Forest University graduate, tweeted after North Carolina\u2019s new law passed that \"A man has never used an LGBT non-discrimination law to sneak into a bathroom.\"\nMaza has also polled public school systems that allow transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as. In a June 2015 article, he wrote that in 17 districts with a total of 600,00 students, officials hadn\u2019t reported a single incident of \"harassment or inappropriate behavior\" related to transgender students and bathrooms.\nBut we still weren\u2019t satisfied, so we kept digging, looking for examples of proven criminal behavior. We were likewise unable to find any examples in the United States, though we did find a case in Canada.\nIn that case, Christopher Hambrook posed as a woman to gain entry to women\u2019s shelters, where he attacked several people before being caught. Hambrook was sentenced to an \"indefinite\" jail term in 2014 that could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison.\nHambrook committed the crimes in Toronto, which has an ordinance protecting transgender people. That appears to be the first, and so far only, incident of its kind in North America.\nAfter spending hours combing through conservative blogs and family values websites dedicated to news about transgender bathroom ordinances, we were able to confirm three cases in the United States in the last 17 years in which a biological male was convicted of a crime that involved him in a women\u2019s bathroom or locker room and dressed as a woman.\nIt\u2019s unclear if any of the three identified as transgender women, but none of those cases happened in cities where it would\u2019ve been legal for a transgender woman to use the women\u2019s room anyway. And none involved sexual assault or rape.\nIn 1999, Patrick Hagan was convicted in Tampa, Fla., for punching a woman in a bar bathroom during an argument. In 2010, Norwood Burns was convicted in Gordon County, Georgia, for exposing himself in a Walmart bathroom. In 2011, Thomas Lee Benson was convicted of trespassing in a Clackamas, Oregon, women\u2019s locker room and trying to talk to children.\nAgain, though, none of those crimes occurred in places where biological men would\u2019ve had any legal claim to being in a women\u2019s room by virtue of being a transgender woman.\nThe blogs did identify a few examples of alleged criminal activity having taken place under the guise of transgender-friendly bathrooms laws, but we couldn\u2019t find proof of any convictions in those cases.","cleaned_claim":"There have not been any public safety issues in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.","ambiguity_score":0.7726946473,"paraphrases":[["There have been no public safety issues in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with.",0.0144469906],["There have not been any public safety issues in cities that allow transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender they identify as.

It required that whenever an officer on\u00a0or off-duty kills someone, there will be an investigation by at least two investigators, \"neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death.\"\nOnce the investigation is complete, the report goes to the district attorney in the county where the death took place for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the report is made public.\nMichael Scott is the director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and clinical professor in criminology at Arizona State University. Scott told us that analysts for the Wisconsin Legislature in 2014 found no other state required an independent investigation for police-related deaths. Scott said this measure\u00a0came after a 10-year effort by one family.\n\"The push for this legislation in Wisconsin came from a coalition organized by Mr. Michael Bell, the father of a young man shot and killed by police in Wisconsin,\" Scott said. \"Two state legislators, Sen. Gary Bies and Rep. Chris Taylor, took up his cause and sponsored the legislation that Gov. Walker signed. Gov. Walker can take credit for signing the legislation, but it was not proposed by his office.\"\nWe found legislators in several states, including Connecticut, California, New York and Missouri, introduced similar measures in 2015, but so far, none have passed.\nWe also learned from the Walker campaign that many local police departments in Wisconsin and around the country already require an independent investigation. However, those policies are not state law.\nA funding wrinkle\nThere was a brief flap in Wisconsin over the money to pay for these inquiries. PolitiFact Wisconsin reported that Walker\u2019s initial 2015 budget provided no funds. But after the attorney general, a Republican, told House budget writers that this was not a cheap endeavor, and a state report showed the state\u2019s Justice Department had investigated 12 deaths in less than a year since the law took effect, lawmakers agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested.\nWalker\u2019s office agreed, and the governor signed a two-year budget that included $635,000 for the work.","cleaned_claim":"I'm the only governor in America ... who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody.","ambiguity_score":0.0780219436,"paraphrases":[["I'm the only governor in America who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation whenever someone dies while in police custody.",0.0263266172],["I'm the only governor in America who has signed a law that requires an independent investigation whenever someone dies in police custody.",0.0780219436],["I am the only governor in America who has signed a law requiring an independent investigation whenever someone dies in police custody.",0.050084319],["I am the only governor in America who has signed a law that requires an independent investigation whenever someone dies while in police custody.",0.0698265582],["I am the only governor in America who has signed a law requiring an independent investigation any time someone dies in police custody.",0.0593429208]]}

China has a basic VAT of 17 percent, while the United States has none. However, the VAT applies to most goods sold in China, regardless of where they are made. And the VATaffects domestic producers the same as foreign ones.\nIf Trump was thinking of import tariffs, he has a different problem. Yes, China\u2019s tariffs are higher than those imposed by the United States, but the Chinese exporters do face a tax when they sell in this country. So in terms of tariffs, Trump is wrong.\nNo expert or report we found from impartial sources suggested that taxes of any sort presented a challenge to American firms that sell in China. There are problems, but they stem from other things China does.\nWhatever tax or tariff Trump had in mind, he either exaggerated the impact on trade or got the U.S. rate wrong. We rate this claim Mostly False.","full_article":"Donald Trump loves to tell voters\u00a0he\u2019s all about getting a better deal for America. It\u2019s a theme he invokes repeatedly when it comes to trade.\nIn a recent interview with two New York Times reporters, Trump called for a different mind set.\n\"I do know my subject, and I do know that our country cannot continue to do what it\u2019s doing,\" Trump said. \"It\u2019s very hard for us to do business in China, it\u2019s very easy for China to do business with us. Plus with us, there\u2019s a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into China, whereas when China sells to us, there\u2019s no tax. I mean, it\u2019s a whole double standard.\"\nWe wondered, is there a hefty tax when American firms sell in China, while there\u2019s no tax that Chinese firms face when they sell here?\nWe asked the Trump campaign for background information on this and didn\u2019t hear back.\nThe trade experts we reached told us there two possible ways to interpret what Trump means by a \"tax that we pay when we go into China.\" He might have meant China\u2019s value-added tax, or VAT, or he might have meant China\u2019s import tariffs. We\u2019ll explore both.\nValue Added Tax\nThis tax is collected at each stage in the production or distribution of a product or service, but with a refund mechanism for VAT paid on purchased units so the final burden falls on the final buyer or consumer. So for example, when a clothing wholesaler sells some shirts to a retailer, the tax is booked on the wholesaler\u2019s mark-up. When the retailer sells the shirt to a customer, the tax is booked again. But the retailer gets a credit back for the tax paid by the wholesaler.\nChina, along with about 160 other countries including Euro Zone members, has a VAT. The United States does not.\nChina\u2019s basic VAT is 17 percent, but some items, such as agricultural products, are not taxed at all, and some products face a lower rate of 13 percent.\nSo in terms of a VAT, Trump has a point. But it isn\u2019t one that has to do with a tax that uniquely raises the price of American goods and services sold in China. By and large, the VAT applies to all sales, regardless of where the product was made. It raises the costs for everybody.\n\"VAT or not doesn\u2019t make much difference,\" said John Graham, a professor of international business at the UC Irvine Paul Merage School of Business.\nAn analysis of challenges in U.S.-China trade relations by the Congressional Research Service, the policy think tank of Congress, makes no mention of China\u2019s value-added tax.\nThe Office of U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s 2015 report on China does mention China\u2019s VAT, but only in the way the government used VAT rebates to reduce costs for Chinese exporters.\n\"These practices have caused tremendous disruption, uncertainty, and unfairness in the global markets for some products,\" the report says, especially for products where China is a leading world producer, such as steel, aluminum and soda ash.\nWhile that allows Chinese manufacturers to sell more cheaply overseas, it doesn\u2019t make it more expensive for any foreign company to compete for sales in China.\nFor the record, it is worth putting China\u2019s VAT into context. With one exception, countries in the European Union charge a higher rate. Luxembourg\u2019s is the same as China\u2019s, but Germany\u2019s is 19 percent, France\u2019s is 20 percent and Italy\u2019s is 22 percent.\nTariffs\nTariffs are essentially a tax on imports. On this front, China imposes higher rates than does the United States.\nHere\u2019s how it breaks down, according to the World Trade Organization:\nThere are different ways to summarize tariffs. The table above is adjusted for the volume of trade of different goods in each broad category, but regardless of how you cut it, China has higher tariffs than the United States.\nHowever, Trump said Chinese goods faced no tax in the United States. That\u2019s inaccurate. For agricultural goods, the tax is 2.5 percent. For non-agricultural goods, it is 2.9 percent.\n\"If Trump was referring to tariffs, which are a kind of tax, then it is clearly incorrect that Chinese products come into the U.S. tariff-free,\" said Joel Trachtman, a trade law specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that as a member of the World Trade Organization, China treats all importers the same, except if it has a separate free-trade deal. So, all things being equal, every WTO trading partner pays the same import tariff as the United States. China does have a number of free-trade treaties with many Asian countries, plus ones with Australia, Chile and others.\nJulia Ya Qin, professor of law at Wayne State University, told us that it\u2019s not unusual for the United States to have lower rates than China.\n\"Industrialized countries generally have lower tariffs than developing countries,\" Qin said. \"Hence, countries such as India, Turkey, Argentina have much higher average tariffs than the United States, the EU, Canada, Japan on industrial products. China is somewhere in between the two groups.\"\nOverall, while the United States and others have had trade disputes with China, they don\u2019t hinge on tariffs or taxes.\n\"Generally, they are not major problems even in most cases worldwide,\" said Stuart Malawer, professor of law and international trade at George Mason University. Malawer served on the Virginia governor\u2019s trade mission to China. \"The real problem are non-tariff barriers. China has a significant number of them. These are primarily regulatory.\"\nA leading example on the regulatory side has to do with beef. In 2014, China used food safety rules to block beef imports.\nMalawer reviewed the history of trade disputes between the United States and China and told us that tariffs and taxes \"are not an issue between the U.S. and China.\"","cleaned_claim":"There\u2019s a tremendous tax that we pay when we American businesses go into China, whereas when China sells to us there\u2019s no tax.","ambiguity_score":0.0444250032,"paraphrases":[["There's a big tax that US businesses have to pay when they do business in China, but when China sells to the US, there's no tax.",0.0138031449],["There is a significant tax burden on American businesses when they operate in China, while there is no such tax on Chinese businesses when they sell to America.",0.0189395901],["There is a large tax that US businesses have to pay when they do business in China, but when China sells to the US there is no tax.",0.0131279472],["There is a large tax that American businesses have to pay when they do business in China, but when China sells to America there is no tax.",0.0131366551],["There is a very high tax that American businesses have to pay when they operate in China, whereas there is no tax when China sells to America.",0.0444250032]]}

Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill.\"\nIn 2020, at the end of the Trump administration, the publicly held debt did exceed 100% of GDP for the first time since World War II. It\u2019s down since then.\nA broader measure, the gross federal debt, which includes funds lent from one part of the government to another, has been above 100% of GDP since 2012, well before Biden became president.\nChanges in federal debt levels are largely driven by mandatory spending beyond the direct control of any president, and much of the rest has been initiated by lawmakers and presidents from both parties. The debt-to-GDP ratio surged in 2020 because of the federal response to the pandemic and the economic contraction.\nWe rate the statement Half True.","full_article":"Four years after passing a major tax cut that slashed federal revenues, Republicans are raising alarms about the national debt again.\nPresident Joe Biden has already signed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus and economic relief package known as the American Rescue Plan, and he\u2019s pushing to enact perhaps trillions more in federal spending for infrastructure and other priorities.\nOne Republican argument against these measures has been their impact on the national debt, although Biden has also proposed tax increases to fund some of his plans.\nFormer U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, took a shot at Biden\u2019s fiscal policy in a June 28 Facebook post.\n\"The national debt is now bigger than our economy,\" she wrote. \"That hasn\u2019t happened since World War Two \u2014 and we\u2019re in peacetime. Joe Biden is digging a hole America can never fill. But he doesn\u2019t care. When the bill comes due, he\u2019ll be long gone.\"\nShe is correct about the debt ratio \u2014 the nation\u2019s publicly held debt did exceed its gross domestic product at the end of 2020, for the first time since World War II. But Haley\u2019s post focused narrowly on one measure of government debt. And it goes too far in associating Biden\u2019s policies with the nation\u2019s debt burden.\nThe two parts of the debt-to-GDP ratio are intertwined: Governments may take on more debt to finance programs that promote economic growth. And as a country\u2019s economy grows, so does its borrowing capacity. But at a certain level, high government debt can also inhibit economic growth by raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.\nThe debt reaching 100% of GDP sounds scary, but economists say it\u2019s not necessarily an ominous sign for a country like the U.S. that has strong credit, big reserve assets and expansive borrowing capacity. Such countries can more easily manage their debt loads, and keep their governments functioning over the long term, without resorting to tax increases, said Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, in a 2019 speech. So the \"hole\" Haley refers to doesn\u2019t affect the U.S. the way it would a weaker economy.\nStill, it\u2019s a development that attracts notice from commentators and politicians, such as Haley, who is a potential 2024 presidential candidate.\nTwo measures of debt\nThere are two widely used metrics for federal debt, and both are considered valid. Haley\u2019s historical claim about the ratio is right if you use one measure and wrong if you use the other.\nThe smaller of the two figures is known as publicly held debt. This includes the debt held by the general public through Treasury bills, bonds and notes. Some is held by U.S. nationals, and some by foreigners.\nThe larger figure is called gross federal debt. It takes the publicly held debt and adds to it the debt that the government owes itself. This typically happens when trust funds, such as those that pay for Social Security and Medicare, accept federal IOUs.\nHaley is correct that the publicly held debt recently crossed the threshold of 100% of the nation\u2019s GDP for the first time since World War II. But it\u2019s worth noting that this milestone occurred at the end of 2020 \u2014 the\u00a0last full year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\nIn just that one year, the ratio soared from 79% to 100%, as the government spent heavily to fight the coronavirus and the resulting economic slowdown.\nMeanwhile, the gross federal debt has been at or above 100% of GDP at every year\u2019s end since 2012. So the year-end level was already there during most of Barack Obama\u2019s administration and through all of Trump\u2019s.\nHow much is Biden\u2019s responsibility?\nA representative for Haley told PolitiFact that her statement was simply stating a fact about the level of debt, and arguing that Biden\u2019s policies would worsen that percentage going forward.\nBut Haley\u2019s use of the word \"now\" in conjunction with the critique of Biden\u2019s policies gives the impression that she holds Biden responsible for a debt milestone that was crossed before he took office.\nOn Biden\u2019s watch, the ratio of publicly held debt to GDP has actually dipped slightly below 100%. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, it stood at 99.75% of GDP. It could fluctuate in the coming months as the post-pandemic economic recovery gains steam.\nThe Congressional Budget Office has projected that the federal debt will dip below 100% of GDP between 2023 and 2025 before rising again to 106% in 2031, due in part to delayed spending provisions of the American Rescue Plan. That analysis assumes that all other tax and spending laws stay the same, so it doesn\u2019t account for Biden\u2019s plans to raise taxes to pay for some of his spending proposals and otherwise increase tax collections.\nIn general, it\u2019s overly simplistic to blame, or credit, any president for changes in the federal debt.\nMuch of our current level of debt has been driven by mandatory spending on Social Security and Medicare, which have been increasing due to the aging of the Baby Boom generation. These expenditures have essentially been on autopilot.\nFor other types of spending, it takes both the president and Congress to enact legislation, and control of the White House and Congress has shifted between the parties in recent years.\nThe Trump tax cuts of 2017 widened the government\u2019s annual deficits substantially, but didn\u2019t move the debt-to-GDP ratio much, because the economy was growing in tandem with government borrowing.\nBiden has proposed some substantial increases in spending to spur the economy. The American Rescue Plan Act cost $1.9 trillion and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would increase deficits by $1.8 trillion between 2021 and 2031.\nOther elements of Biden\u2019s agenda would be offset by tax increases, largely on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. It\u2019s not at all clear that any of Biden\u2019s pending legislative proposals will ever be enacted, much less at the levels he initially proposed for them. His infrastructure proposal, for instance, has already been cut down in size during bipartisan negotiations.\n\"Obviously, trillions of dollars have been enacted under Biden,\" said Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. \"But so, too, under Trump, Obama, and George W. Bush. Anytime someone tries to pin responsibility for the national debt on one political figure, they\u2019ve got to take a few shortcuts with the truth.\"","cleaned_claim":"The national debt is now bigger than our economy.

Scott Walker wants state taxpayers to dole out up to $250 million annually in incentives to Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn to lure a manufacturing plant to Wisconsin that he claims will generate $181 million in tax revenue.\n\nThink about that. Gov. Walker proposes we pay about $70 million more a year in incentives to a foreign corporation than will flow back to our state coffers. Does that sound like a good deal to you?\nSo is that really the deal: Taxpayers pay up to $250 million a year to get the manufacturing plant, but get back only $181 million a year in tax revenue?\nThis claim is essentially correct on the two numbers, but it leaves out a big part of the equation.\nThe deal\nTwo days before the blog post, Walker joined President Donald Trump and other officials at the White House to announce\u00a0that Foxconn, after considering several other states, had decided to put the first liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturing facility in North America in Wisconsin. The displays would be made for computer screens, televisions and the dashboards of cars.\nWalker tweeted that the company, perhaps best known for making Apple\u2019s iPhone at factories in China, would be bringing 13,000 jobs to the state. We rated his claim Half True. Foxconn itself has said only that the plant will create 3,000 jobs, \"with the potential to grow to 13,000 new jobs.\"\nMuch hinges on the company\u2019s pledge to invest $10 billion, in exchange for $3 billion in incentives from the state.\nThe numbers\nTo back its statement, One Wisconsin Now pointed us to reports from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said the $3 billion in incentives could be doled out at a rate of $200 million to $250 million per year over 15 years; and that the state expects to collect $181 million in state and local tax revenue annually.\nBut it stands to reason the state wouldn\u2019t approve a losing deal without expecting something more.\nAnd that\u2019s what we heard from the economic and tax experts we talked to.

Tammy Baldwin concerns the Iran deal that President Donald Trump recently withdrew from.\nThe deal, Nicholson declared, had \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.\"\nNicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir are running in the August 2018 Republican primary for the right to challenge Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, in the November 2018 general election.\nThe Delafield businessman made the statement on May 30, 2018, to conservative Green Bay radio talk show host John Muir. It is one he has made repeatedly.\nHe mostly misses.\nThe backdrop\nAbout three weeks before Nicholson made the radio claim, Trump announced the United States would pull out of the nuclear pact with Iran and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, saying the deal failed to contain the regime\u2019s nuclear ambitions and regional meddling.\nThe easy part of Nicholson\u2019s claim to check is Iran\u2019s connection to terrorism. Iran has been on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. Those countries (Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea) have been determined to have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\"\nBut let\u2019s get to the thrust of Nicholson\u2019s claim -- that the deal merely \"handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes\" to Iran and that Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it.\nThe cash\nThe deal, struck in July 2015 under President Barack Obama, was with Iran, the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. The deal restricted certain Iranian nuclear activities for periods between 10 to 25 years, and allowed for more intrusive, permanent monitoring. It also prohibited Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons in the future.\nSo, it wasn\u2019t just merely turning over cash to Iran.\nAs part of the deal, Iran did get access to tens of billions of dollars in assets \u00a0\u2014 but the vast majority of those assets are Iran\u2019s own money.\nAnd what cash was delivered on a plane was far less than billions.\nAs our PolitiFact colleagues have reported:\nThe deal released Iranian assets frozen under a variety of sanctions. The assets, cash in the bank, real estate or something else, belonged to Iran in the first place. The total value \u00a0\u2014 worldwide \u2014 of freed Iranian assets was about $56 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, Iran received about $1.7 billion from the United States \u00a0\u2014 $400 million plus interest. The payment was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal. The money was legally due to Iran. The country had paid America for military equipment in 1979, but the Iranian revolution came and the hardware was never delivered.\nMany news organizations reported the delivery of the $400 million in an unmarked cargo plane after American officials were certain that three Americans held in Iran were on their way home. It is not known how the remaining $1.3 billion made its way to Iran.\nAs for Baldwin\u2019s backing of the Iran deal, she wasn\u2019t among the first. Her campaign cited reports showing that Baldwin announced her support on Aug. 7, 2015 \u00a0\u2014 after 13 other senators had done so.","cleaned_claim":"The Iran deal handed billions of dollars of cash on cargo planes, sent it to a state sponsor of terror, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first U.S. senators to get on board and support that.","ambiguity_score":0.5273708701,"paraphrases":[["The Iran deal involved transferring large amounts of money to a country that sponsors terrorism, and Tammy Baldwin was one of the first senators to support it.",0.0355400741],["The Iran deal gave Iran billions of dollars in cash, which they then used to sponsor terrorism.

However, we wanted to see if \"ALL taxpayers\" will have reduced tax rates.\nIn support of the House bill\nFirst, we confirmed that Barletta was referring to the House version of the bill in his tweet. One of the major differences between the two bills is the number of income tax brackets and corresponding tax rates.\nThe House bill changes the current number of seven tax brackets to four, which would be 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent.\nOn average, each income group will receive a tax cut\nDavid Jackson, a spokesman for Barletta, sent\u00a0a report on the House bill\u00a0by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee in Congress, as the source for Barletta\u2019s tweet.\n\"According to the Joint Committee, in 2019, Americans in every income category will see a tax cut,\" Jackson told\u00a0PolitiFact Pennsylvania.\nThe table in the report shows that, on average, each income group will have a reduced effective tax rate in 2019 compared to the current law. But that isn\u2019t what Barletta tweeted.\nBarletta\u2019s tweet made it seem as if every single taxpayer will see a rate reduction, which contradicts\u00a0a report released by the Tax Policy Center. In 2018, if broken down into quintiles, a little more than 7 percent of individuals will be subjected to an increased tax rate. About 75 percent of individuals will receive a tax cut.\n\"There are specific individuals in each income group that would actually pay higher taxes,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told\u00a0PolitiFact Pennsylvania.\nIn 2018, the percentage of individuals with a tax increase in the lowest income distribution would be 1.7 percent, 6 percent in the second, 9.2 percent in the middle, 11.5 percent in the fourth and 12.9 percent in the top.\nThe \u2018chained Consumer Price Index\u2019 and \u2018bubble rate\u2019 create some tax rate increases\nThe House and Senate bill both propose using chained CPI to index standard deductions according to inflation. Standard deductions include $12,000 for single filers, $18,300 for households and $24,400 for joint filers in the House bill.\nStarting in 2018, the chained CPI would also move some individuals into higher tax brackets at a faster pace since bracket cutoffs would be moved in relation to a lower inflation measure. Gleckman said that process will contribute to average tax rates going up by 2027. This will likely increase the percentage of individuals with tax rate increases in 2027 to more than 25 percent compared to the 7 percent in 2018.\n\"What will happen is middle-income people and lower-income people will end up paying slightly higher taxes than they do under current law,\" Gleckman said.\nAt first, the bill will increase the effective tax rates of some individuals in the top 1 percent. The \"bubble rate\" put in the bill for individual income rates and brackets would make the top effective tax rates rise to 49.4 percent for some high-income taxpayers, and then fall by 2027.\n\"Over time, the tax rates of the poor and middle class move higher than they were in 2017,\" Temple University economics professor Michael Leeds said, \"while the taxes of the rich and ultra-rich stay below 2017 levels [in 2027].\"","cleaned_claim":"GDP is booming.

(Sanders quoted him accurately.)\nBloomberg went on to describe what he would support: raising the Earned Income Tax Credit. Doing so, he said, would reduce the burden on employers and protect jobs.\n\"I think you should raise the income tax credit, which does the same thing for the same people, but it spreads the burden across all the taxpayers rather than just a small number of businesspeople whose inclination would be to cut back employment. Earned Income Tax Credit doesn\u2019t get anybody to cut back, it gets them to hire more people.\"\nThe federal Earned Income Tax Credit reduces taxes for low- and moderate-income working people. About 29 states have passed their own earned-income tax credit. While mayor in 2004, Bloomberg signed legislation starting a local tax credit.\nIn 2018, Bloomberg again called for using the tax credit rather than hiking the minimum wage. During an interview with Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, he repeated his concern that a hike in the minimum wage would lead to job losses. (The Congressional Budget Office has found far more people would receive wage hikes than likely lose their jobs under a national increase to $15 an hour.)\nBloomberg\u2019s support for the tax credit rather than a rise in the minimum wage is shared by some experts. However, others say the two policies can work in tandem, and both could help poor workers.\nWhile Bloomberg spoke broadly against a minimum wage increase, in 2012 he did support raising the minimum wage in New York to $8.25 an hour. Also, Bloomberg had a mixed record on living-wage proposals to lift wages of certain workers who were employed by entities that had city contracts. When Bloomberg opposed such measures, he raised concerns about the cost for the city or the impact on economic development.\nBloomberg now supports $15 minimum wage\nDuring his 2020 campaign for president, Bloomberg has called for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He also calls for enhancing the tax credit.\nBloomberg\u2019s labor plan says he will sign the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the minimum wage gradually over six years to $15 an hour.

But that applies only to sixth through 12th grades.\nAnd there isn\u2019t evidence to show that Wisconsin\u2019s teacher standards overall would be the weakest in the country.\nWe rate Tate\u2019s statement Half True.","full_article":"In one of his final public appearances as chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Mike Tate made an observation about the Republican-controlled Legislature and a broad claim about where GOP leaders are taking schools with the 2015-\u201917 state budget.\n\"I think you\u2019re beginning to see the beginning of the end of the overreach of the Republican majority in Madison,\" Tate said May 28, 2015 at a WisPolitics luncheon in Madison.\nThen he flatly stated: \"Just yesterday, you saw slipped into the budget a provision that would have Wisconsin have the weakest standards for who can be a teacher in the classroom in the country.\"\nLet\u2019s see if the changes -- which, as we\u2019ll see, apply only to teachers in middle and high school -- would leave Wisconsin with the weakest teacher standards in the country.\nThe budget\nThe day before Tate\u2019s remarks, there were news stories highlighting the Republicans\u2019 proposal on teacher licensing.\nThe proposal had actually been added to the budget eight days earlier, on May 20, 2015, when the Legislature's GOP-run Joint Finance Committee, in a 1:30 a.m. vote, inserted it along with other education provisions.\nThe Legislature is aiming to adopt a budget and send it to GOP Gov. Scott Walker before the end of June 2015. Walker has not stated a position on the teacher proposal but does have the power to veto individual provisions out of the budget.\nGOP proposal\nAs it stands now, public school teachers in Wisconsin must be licensed by the state Department of Public Instruction. A bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited university is one of the minimum requirements. Teachers must also pass state tests that assess their knowledge of a subject as well as their skills in teaching.\nUnder the GOP proposal, the Department of Instruction would be required to issue teaching licenses to individuals who are deemed qualified by a local school board to teach in middle or high school (sixth through 12th grade), though the license would be good only for that school district.\nThere would be two major changes under this alternative form of licensing.\n1. Anyone with a bachelor\u2019s degree -- in any subject, and from an accredited or non-accredited university -- could be licensed to teach the so-called core subjects of English, math, social studies or science. The only requirement would be that a school board would have to determine that the person is \"proficient in the subject\" and has \"relevant experience\" in the subject. Unlike the standard licensing system, the teacher would not have to pass any state tests to prove his or her subject knowledge or teaching knowledge.\nThe National Council on Teacher Quality, an independent research group, and the Education Commission on the States said they did not know how many states have teacher standards like that one.\n2. For non-core subjects -- such as health or foreign language -- \u00a0no college degree, or even a high school diploma, would be required. Again, no state tests would be required, only that a school board determine that a person is \"proficient in the subject\" and has \"relevant experience\" in the subject.\nA memo on the GOP proposal from the Wisconsin Legislative Council, a nonpartisan research agency that serves the Legislature, says that every state requires a minimum of a bachelor's degree for all grades. The only exception is for technical education.\nIn addition, a spokeswoman for the National Council on Teacher Quality told us it knows of no state that doesn't require at least a bachelor's degree.\n(The only evidence the Democratic Party cited to us to back Tate\u2019s claim was an Associated Press news article saying Wisconsin may be the first state in the country to certify teachers who don't have bachelor's degrees.)\nThe changes were proposed by state Rep. Mary Czaja, R-Irma. She told us she wants schools to be able to hire teachers who can \"fill a niche\" -- for example, hiring a nurse with a two-year degree to teach health, or a local mechanic to teach auto mechanics -- without having to hire a permanent teacher at a higher salary plus benefits.

And the sightings were during the more dramatic king tides, when high tides are at their highest, not during average daily high tides.\nOverall, we rate his statement Half True.","full_article":"As the world watched President Barack Obama\u2019s news conference about climate change, he drew on South Florida to illustrate a point about the impact -- and he zeroed in on fish.\n\"As the science around climate change is more accepted, as people start realizing that even today you can put a price on the damage that climate change is doing -- you go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets, you know, that -- there's a cost to that,\" Obama said at the climate change conference in Paris Dec. 1.\nThat opened the floodgates to a question about whether there are truly fish in the streets.\nAt a town hall event in Iowa, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u00a0was among the skeptics: \"Obama said today the streets of Miami are flooded and fish are falling on them. I live there. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\u2019\u2019\nSo is it a tall tale that fish swim in the streets of Miami? It\u2019s certainly not a regular occurrence. But some people, including a few public officials, say they have seen it. And most importantly,\u00a0it has\u00a0been caught on video.\nThe source of Obama\u2019s fish story\nSpokespersons for the White House sent us news articles from 2014 and 2015 about flooding from king tides in South Florida. (King tides, for those who aren\u2019t familiar with the term, are the highest predicted high tides and happen once or twice a year on the Florida coast. They occur when the orbits and alignment of the Earth, moon, and sun combine to produce the greatest tidal effects of the year.)\n\"There were fish swimming in the street,\" John Morgan, a Delray Beach city official, told the Sun-Sentinel in October 2014 after a few inches of sea water accumulated without any rain.\nMorgan told PolitiFact that he has seen fish on Marine Way, a road in a low-lying area, as well as at Veterans Park.\n\"I have been with the city a couple years now, and I\u2019ve probably seen the fish in the streets at least a half dozen times,\" said Morgan, who now heads up his city\u2019s environmental department.\nA Hollywood resident, Robin Rorapaugh, told the Miami Herald\u2019s Public Insight Network in October 2015 that king tides had grown in her neighborhood and that \"anyone who doubts climate change should witness the sea come through the storm drains \u2014 fish were swimming in the street.\"\nWe also found video evidence that supported Obama\u2019s point. A Sept. 28 TV news report featured video showing a fish swimming on Cordova Road in Fort Lauderdale.\n\"Look at that,\" a bystander said. \"A mullet in the street.\"\nNancy Gassman, assistant public works director in Fort Lauderdale, told PolitiFact Florida that fish on the streets are a \"regular occurrence\" during high tide flooding in Las Olas Isles and Las Olas Boulevard.\n\"In past tidal flooding, I personally have seen fish in\u00a0the streets,\" she said.\nObama\u2019s comments echoed a recent statement by former Vice President Al Gore, who told NPR in November:\n\"I was in Miami last month and fish from the ocean were swimming on some of the streets on a sunny day because it was a high tide. In Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, many other places \u2013 that happens regularly.\"\nOur efforts to reach Gore were unsuccessful. However, Miami Beach officials told PolitiFact that Gore\u2019s comment stems from a tour during a conference about climate change that happened to coincide with the king tides.\nMiami Beach officials, including assistant city manager\/public works director Eric Carpenter, showed Gore the impact of the tides on the state-owned Indian Creek Drive where the water washes over the sea wall onto the street.\n\"I absolutely saw the fish,\" Carpenter told PolitiFact. \"You can actually see the fish swimming out of the creek, past the mangrove trees that are there and into the street. I probably saw close to a dozen. They weren\u2019t big fish, but I don\u2019t know, two or three inches long?\"\nWhile working on temporary fixes to the road to try to alleviate flooding, Carpenter said he saw the fish on several occasions. \"It was not an isolated incident,\" he said.\nFlooding has become an expensive problem for places such as Miami Beach, which flood for several days twice a year as a result of king tides. The coastal city is on track to spend around $500 million to install 80 pumps and raise roads and seawalls across the city. The Herald reported that while the city has flooded for decades during king tides, it has been getting worse.\n\"The king tides have gotten higher in recent years,\" said Colin Polsky, director of the center for environmental studies at Florida Atlantic University, told the Herald. \"And the king tides we're seeing more recently have been higher than they were predicted to be.\"\nIt\u2019s important to point out that sightings of fish in the street are not common. Hollywood City Commissioner Patty Asseff, who lives across the street from the intracoastal, said she had never heard of fish in the streets.\n\"It was the first I had heard about fish in the streets,\" she told PolitiFact after reading Obama\u2019s comments about Miami. \"We have water, we have flooding, but fish I haven\u2019t seen yet.\"\nIn the past year, the city of Hollywood has spent more than $1 million on flood gates and pumps in parts of the city to alleviate flooding.\nFor the record, Obama\u2019s statement was technically about Miami -- not Miami Beach.\nMiami public works director Eduardo Santamaria said he wasn\u2019t aware of fish on the streets in Miami, but he said the city is higher than Miami Beach and parts of Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood.","cleaned_claim":"You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets.","ambiguity_score":0.0482671224,"paraphrases":[["You go down to Miami and you see fish swimming in the streets because of the flooding during high tide on sunny days.",0.0476113595],["In Miami, when it rains heavily and the tides are high, fish can be seen swimming in the streets.",0.0482671224],["In Miami, during high tide on a sunny day, you can see fish swimming in the streets.",0.012917147],["In Miami, during high tide on a sunny day, fish can be seen swimming in the streets.",0.0137216616],["When it's high tide and sunny in Miami, the streets can flood and fish can be seen swimming in the water.",0.0146956583]]}

Trump has signed a relatively large number of bills so far, but comparatively few with significant impact. And while some of his executive orders have made an immediate impact, most have merely expressed his policy preferences or set in motion a process that may, or may not, change policies down the road.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.","full_article":"Some commentators called it \"the weirdest Cabinet meeting ever\": President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership team gathered to deliver a litany of praise for the president.\nTrump saved some of the boasting for himself, making claims that his administration has been one of historic accomplishments.\n\"I will say that never has there been a president -- with few exceptions; in the case of FDR, he had a major depression to handle -- who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated,\" Trump said, later adding, \"We've achieved tremendous success.\"\nWe\u2019ve previously checked Trump\u2019s claim in April that \"no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days\" and found that assertion to be False. But given the high-profile setting of Trump\u2019s comment -- his first formal Cabinet meeting -- we decided to take a look at his new statement.\nPresidential and congressional scholars aren\u2019t any more convinced than they were in April. \"Trump\u2019s boasts are empty,\" said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency.\nLegislation signed by Trump\nWhen we checked with the White House, they noted that in this remark Trump acknowledged exceptions such as Roosevelt. They also pointed to the statistics for the number of laws and executive orders signed by a president in 100 days --\u00a0a metric that Trump fares well on.\nAround the 100-day point of Trump\u2019s presidency, we found that White House press secretary Sean Spicer was accurate on the numbers when he said that the current president has \"worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since (Harry) Truman.\" We noted that in the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills; the president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28.\nHowever, none of the bills Trump had signed at that point qualified as major pieces of legislation. None of the ones since are, either. They include, among others, two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee.\nWhile the White House is pursuing several major issues in Congress -- notably the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to cut taxes and promote infrastructure -- it would be premature for Trump to take credit for these. The health care bill has passed the House but not yet passed the Senate, while the tax and infrastructure measures haven\u2019t even gotten that far.\nTrump is \"correct that he has signed a rather large, although not unprecedented, number of bills,\" Skidmore said. However, \"most of the bills he has signed are routine and unimportant.\"\nSarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist who specializes in Congress, agreed that \"the absence of significant legislative movement is glaring. Contrary to Trump's statement, this is a Republican government struggling to legislate, despite control of both chambers and the White House.\"\nBy contrast, even if you set aside Franklin D. Roosevelt -- as Trump did -- other presidents signed more far-reaching legislation during their first 100 days.\nBill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Barack Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Obama also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush\u2019s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout.\nMeanwhile, John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress), while Truman\u2019s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender.\nTrump\u2019s most significant legislative achievements may be his use of the Congressional Review Act -- a previously little-used power that makes it easier for Congress and the president to overturn federal regulations.\n\"Some of these regulations are substantively and politically important,\" such as the overturning of the Stream Protection Act, an environmental regulation that Trump and others said harmed coal mining, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist.\nStill, Koger added, \"these definitely do not rise to the level of \u2018landmark\u2019 legislation, or even \u2018major\u2019 legislation.\" And John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, added that such powers were not available to most postwar presidents, since the Congressional Review Act was only passed in the 1990s. This makes comparisons with past presidents difficult, he said.\nTrump\u2019s executive orders\nAs president, Trump has signed some three dozen executive orders, which also places him numerically above the presidents since Franklin Roosevelt.\nA number of these orders have addressed high-profile issues, and some could potentially have significant impacts. One -- a visa ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations -- remains tied up in lawsuits and is headed to the Supreme Court. Another notable order directs the Treasury Department to stop collecting penalties related to not having health insurance. If this policy is followed and isn\u2019t blocked by the courts, \"it could cripple this aspect of the Affordable Care Act without altering the law,\" Frendreis said.\nTrump also used executive orders to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and to green-light key pipelines that had been held up by the Obama administration. And Trump also announced that the United States would be pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, though he didn\u2019t use an executive order in that case.\nThese are significant policy changes -- but it\u2019s important to note some caveats about Trump\u2019s use of executive orders.\nFirst, many of these orders started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations, rather than overturning them in one fell swoop. Often, Congress needs to weigh in to change a law, or Cabinet departments must undertake a lengthy administrative process before policies officially change.\nAnd second, new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party.\nJust two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton\u2019s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions.\n\"Every president uses executive orders, especially when they cannot pass legislation because of a hostile Congress,\" Frendreis said. \"So his actions here are typical, and not unusually impressive. In fact, his need to act administratively instead of legislatively implies legislative weakness, not strength, because he should be able to make policy through the legislative process since he has unified partisan control.\"\nAll told, he said, \"the early Trump presidency stands out in terms of the number of symbolic actions he has taken to \u2018fulfill\u2019 campaign promises, but his record of changing policy is not off to a fast start. Like all presidents, he has taken some impactful actions, but he does not stand out in this regard.\"","cleaned_claim":"Rare is the president who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated.","ambiguity_score":0.8557021022,"paraphrases":[["There have been few presidents who have passed more legislation and done more than what we have done, including issuing executive orders and terminating job-killing regulations.",0.0754742995],["There have been very few presidents who have accomplished more than the current president, in terms of both legislation and executive orders.

There are also studies which show a correlation between high school dropout rates and incarceration.\nHowever, experts say that you can\u2019t assume a direct correlation between reading scores and prison rates based on this data alone. Greene claimed that \"there is a big correlation between third grade reading level ... and whether you go to prison.\" This might be true, but we cannot know for sure.\nIn addition, the results from the 2018 administration of the Florida Standards Assessments show that only 57 percent of third graders pass the reading test at or above grade level. So Greene is correct on that point.\nWe rate this claim Mostly True.","full_article":"With the Florida governor\u2019s Democratic primary set for\u00a0Aug. 28, Jeff Greene has made education a vital piece of his platform.\nIn a July 29 interview, Greene said, \"There is a big correlation between third-grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison. And in Florida right now, only 56 percent of kids are coming out of third grade at third-grade reading level.\"\nIt\u2019s spooky to imagine that the performance of an eight-year-old could predict their destiny more than a decade later. We decided to see if Greene\u2019s statistics held up.\nCorrelation between reading level and college\nA 2010 study by the University of Chicago found that third-grade reading level can be a powerful predictor of future academic success. Researchers tracked thousands of students in the Chicago Public School system from third grade through their high school graduations.\nThe students took a test in the third grade that measured their reading ability and compared their results with national scores. Students who scored lower than 75 percent of third graders nationwide were defined as \"below grade level.\"\nAmong students who read below grade level in third grade, only 45 percent graduated high school in five years. Graduation rates were much higher for students who read at grade-level (60 percent) and above grade level (80 percent).\nThe study controlled for demographic factors, so researchers could examine the correlation\u00a0between test scores and graduation rates without worrying that race or poverty were influencing the results. Though the variables are correlated -- which means a change in one is connected to a change in the other -- the connection is not causal. Low third grade test scores are not causing kids to dropout of high school.\nLikewise, students who read at or below grade level in third grade were significantly less likely to attend college than their peers. Only about 20 percent of below-grade-level students attended college, whereas roughly a third of at grade-level students did. Nearly 60 percent of above-grade-level readers attended college.\nReading level and prison\nThere are no studies that directly connect third-grade reading level to incarceration, so the Greene campaign connected it by a two-step process.\nAs noted in the Chicago study, and backed up by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Georgia governor\u2019s office, students who score below grade level on third grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10.\nSo, the Greene campaign argues, students who read below grade-level in third grade tend not to graduate high school, and people who don\u2019t graduate high school tend to have higher incarceration rates.\nKatharine Abraham, director of the University of Maryland Center for Economics and Public Policy, said this conclusion \"seems plausible but doesn\u2019t necessarily follow from the cited facts.\" The term \"correlation\" implies that two variables are related, and that one will change alongside the other. One can not assume that because variables A and B are related, and B and C are related, A is also correlated to C.\nFor example, there might be a correlation between higher temperatures and sunny days. There might also be a correlation between sunny days and the number of people who get sunburned. However, this does not mean there is a direct correlation between higher temperatures and sunburns.\nWhen asked if it would be accurate to say test scores are correlated to incarceration, Abraham said, \"It might well be true, but you can't logically draw that inference.\"\nThe \"56 percent\"\nGreene also said that only 56 percent of kids in Florida are coming out of third grade at the appropriate reading level. He had more concrete data to back up this claim.\nHe was referring to the results of the most recent administration of the Florida Standards Assessments, which were released in May 2018.\nThe Florida Standards Assessments, or FSA, are a suite of standardized tests that Florida public schools students in grades 3-10 take yearly. They include mathematics exams as well as reading and writing exams.\nStudents\u2019 results on the FSA are classified into five groups, the lowest being Level 1 and highest being Level 5. Level 3 or higher means the student is reading at grade level or above.\nThe spring 2018 results of the English Language Arts (ELA) Grade 3 Reading Exam show that 57 percent of third grade students scored at Level 3 or above.\nSo Greene actually undersold his point. The statistic he was referring to kept track of students reading at or above grade level, not just those reading at grade level.","cleaned_claim":"There is a big correlation between third grade reading level and whether you go to college or whether you go to prison.

You've had more felons, ex-felons register as Republicans than Democrats?\"\nKushner replied: \"That's the data that I've seen. I think that will surprise a lot of people when they see the new coalition that President Trump is building for what the Republican Party has the potential to be.\"\nSo are former felons rushing to join Trump\u2019s party in Florida?\nWe found no statewide data to support Kushner\u2019s conclusion that more ex-felons have registered as Republicans since a new law took effect. At this point in time, his comment isn\u2019t more than wishful thinking.\nWe contacted the White House to ask for Kushner\u2019s data and did not get a reply.\nAmendment 4 allows felons to vote\nIn November, voters approved Amendment 4, which restored voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete their sentence. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses.\nThe Legislature has been debating how to define what it means to complete sentences, while advocates say it requires no further legislation.\nRegardless of that battle, Amendment 4 took effect Jan. 8, and some ex-felons have registered to vote.\nWe interviewed election officials and professors who study voting, as well as advocates for Amendment 4. No one could point to any statewide data showing the partisan breakdown of newly registered ex-felons.\nFlorida\u2019s voter registration application asks applicants to check a box stating: \"I affirm that I am not a convicted felon, or if I am, my right to vote has been restored.\" But on the form there is no way to separate those whose rights have been restored from those who were never felons.\nA spokeswoman for the Florida Division of Elections told us that it doesn\u2019t have partisan voter registration data for ex-felons.\nThat leaves us with anecdotal reports that may not be statistically representative.\nUniversity of Florida professor Daniel A. Smith said that he and his students identified 61 Floridians who identified themselves in media reports in January as \"returning citizens\" -- felons who had regained the right to vote. They were able to find 39 who made it on to Florida\u2019s voter registration list by Feb. 1.\nHe warned that it wasn\u2019t a representative sample, but here\u2019s what they found: Of those 39 individuals, 25 are Democrats, 10 are no party affiliation, and four are Republicans.\nA few of the experts we interviewed wondered if Kushner was referring to an NBC report in February about felon voter registration.\nA graphic in that report was titled \"Florida former felon voting\" and said \"new registrations, top 10 counties.\" The story said: \"Between December and January, Democrats saw a net gain of 711 new registrations in the 10 largest counties in Florida. Republicans actually saw a slightly larger gain in that time in those counties, an increase of 717 registrations.\"\nSo that graphic showed the GOP had a 6-voter registration edge. However, \u00a0the data appears to reflect all registrations in 10 counties, not just felons.\nPast research on felons and party affiliation\nAlthough there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and the majority of black voters are Democrats, in sheer numbers more whites could regain the right to vote in Florida.\nThe national Sentencing Project found in 2016 that of the 1.5 million ex-felons in Florida who could not vote, about 28 percent were black. Of the 72 percent who were not black, most were white, and a modest number were Latinos.\nMichael Morse, a JD candidate at Yale Law School and a PhD candidate in Harvard\u2019s department of government, said he plans to analyze voter registration and conviction data to determine the partisan makeup of the newly registered ex-felons.\n\"Although I\u2019m working on it, it\u2019s not possible to evaluate Kushner\u2019s claim yet,\" he said.\nKushner\u2019s claim depends largely on the racial breakdown of these early registrants, said Morse, who along with University of Pennsylvania professor Marc Meredith looked at the political behavior of the 150,000 ex-felons restored by Gov. Charlie Crist about a decade ago. They wrote about their findings in a November article for Vox.\nThey found that black ex-felons were extremely supportive of the Democratic Party, but all other ex-felons in the state were slightly more supportive of Republicans.\nIn total, they found about 19,500 ex-felons whose rights were restored under Crist voted in 2016 -- about 58 percent were registered Democrats (largely black), 24 percent were registered Republicans (largely nonblack) and the rest registered with neither party.\nThe researchers extrapolated that if all ex-felons could have voted in in 2016, Democrats would have gained a net of 48,000 votes. Trump won the state by more than double that margin.\n\"Clearly there is a preference for the Democratic party, but it\u2019s not an immense preference, particularly\u00a0in voting because of low turnout,\" among felons, he said.\nHowever, the same partisan preferences may not apply to the Amendment 4 population, Morse said. Among all Crist ex-felons who had their rights automatically restored under Crist, 38 percent were black. Among all ex-felons in the state as estimated by the Sentencing Project, only 28 percent are black. Also, no one yet knows the outcome of the battle in the state Legislature about defining fines and fees that must be paid as part of completing their sentence before register to vote.\n\"In short, everything is up in the air,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not yet clear who will benefit from Amendment 4 and what the demographics of that population will be.\"","cleaned_claim":"Florida passed a law where former felons can now vote.

Inexperienced and very experienced Austin teachers were paid more in 2014-15 than peers in some or most nearby districts and if you count Social Security contributions, Austin teachers in general were compensated better on average than teachers in nearby districts. On the other hand, all Austin district teachers were paid less than counterparts in comparable urban districts across the state--even after taking into account Social Security contributions.\nOn balance, we rate this claim Half True.\nHALF TRUE\u2013 The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.\nClick here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","full_article":"In May 2015, the president of Austin\u2019s school board urged state lawmakers to put billions of additional dollars into school aid. The money should flow to teacher pay, Gina Hinojosa said, adding that teachers in the Austin district have lower salaries than peers elsewhere.\nSpecifically, Hinojosa told Austin American-Statesman reporter Kiah Collier: \"Currently our teachers are the lowest paid of any urban, lowest paid of any surrounding school district and we believe that's unacceptable.\"\nThe lowest among whom? \"Amongst all urban districts in the state and amongst surrounding Central Texas school districts,\" Hinojosa said.\nIs all of that so?\nTo our inquiry, Hinojosa said she drew on information gathered by the district. District spokesman Reyne Telles then said by email the comparisons appeared in charts (see them here) showing the salaries of teachers with bachelor\u2019s degrees at different years of experience drawn from information posted online by districts. Telles said the district is \"confident in the numbers,\" which were part of a January 2015 staff presentation to the board.\nLeft out of the comparison: Some 1,675 local teachers with master\u2019s or doctoral degrees who, a district chart indicates, accounted for 29 percent of the district\u2019s 5,842 teachers in 2014-15. By email, a district official, Michael Houser, said the teachers with advanced degrees earned $862 more than other Austin teachers. He said he believes that stipend trailed comparable payments made by the district\u2019s Texas competitors.\nAt any rate, the presentation that Hinojosa relied on shows some Austin teachers making more than Austin-area peers in 2014-15. But the bulk, more than six in 10 by our calculation, had salaries less than what was paid teachers nearby and in selected urban districts around the state.\nHouser told us by phone the district did not compare salaries in all urban districts, focusing instead on those other districts where it\u2019s had recruiting success. Similarly, Houser said, the district did not check salaries in every nearby district, focusing on \"our most immediate competition.\"\nThe district\u2019s charts show:\n--In 2014-15, Austin teachers with five through 30 years of experience were paid less than nearby peers in nearly every instance. Also, those teachers made less than nearly all peers in eight selected urban Texas districts: Cypress-Fairbanks (Harris County), Dallas, El Paso, Fort Bend, Fort Worth, Houston, Northside (Bexar County) and San Antonio. Austin teachers trailed the average pay for teachers in the other districts by $4,422 (for teachers with no experience) to $7,687 (teacher with 10 years\u2019 experience).\n--In contrast, beginning and very experienced Austin teachers mostly drew more in pay than peers in the nine nearby districts: Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville, Round Rock and San Marcos. That is, Austin teachers with no experience were paid $44,046, which exceeded the salary of comparable teachers in each of the nearby districts by a minimum of $546 up to $2,046. The nearby districts paid teachers with no experience an average of $42,810.\n--Austin teachers with 35 years of experience earned $3,595 to $6,104 more than teachers in four of the nearby districts though up to $3,605 less than comparable teachers in the five other Austin-area districts. Austin\u2019s $56,595 salary for such teachers ran $1,406 ahead of the average $58,189 pay for such teachers in the nearby districts.\nSocial Security\nA wrinkle: The district\u2019s charts did not account for money it pays toward Social Security benefits for employees. By phone, Houser told us that\u2019s because what once seemed a recruiting advantage\u2014the district making contributions for Social Security and for pensions through the Teacher Retirement System of Texas\u2014has become an albatross; teachers, Houser said, would prefer to get the district\u2019s Social Security contributions in take-home pay. District spokesman Jacob Barrett said the Austin district is among 47 statewide that long ago committed to backing both benefits.\nHouser said that if Social Security contributions are folded into the comparisons, Austin\u2019s teachers received more in compensation in 2014-15 than peers in the nearby districts. But Austin\u2019s teachers still saw less compensation than counterparts in the urban districts the district considers peers, he said.\nWe checked this by counting as income the district\u2019s Social Security contributions, 6.2 percent of each employee\u2019s gross pay. After these adjustments, Austin\u2019s teacher salaries at every experience level exceeded the average for the nine nearby districts, with the Austin advantage ranging from $324 a year (for teachers with 25 years\u2019 experience) to $5,101 (teachers with 35 years\u2019 experience). But, as Houser said, counting the contributions as income did not propel Austin\u2019s teachers at any experience level to higher pay than the average salaries of peers in the urban districts Austin uses for comparisons. An unknown: Whether Austin teachers will uniformly participate in Social Security long enough to reap full benefits on retirement.\nHealth insurance\nWe also asked if the Austin district compared health insurance benefits by district. By email, Houser pointed out a chart in the board presentation indicating Austin\u2019s payments of $446.25 a month to cover employee health insurance premiums in 2014-15 were more than what nearly every nearby peer district spent; the Lake Travis district expended $537 a worker. The Austin district\u2019s spending also outpaced expenditures for premiums in most of the urban districts selected as peers; the Houston district was paying $500. Austin generally pays more, Houser indicated, to fund a health plan offering more benefits than, say, the TRS-backed plan for which districts in 2014-15 were paying $325 monthly for employee premiums.\nOther pay analyses\nOther pay analyses bore out what we saw in the Austin district\u2019s information.\nFor instance, we asked the Texas Education Agency for its best data on teacher salaries within each district; spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency website where we punched in district names to reach average base salaries for teachers in 2014-15 (not counting Social Security contributions). By this gauge, the Austin district\u2019s average base teacher salary of $47,476 trailed average base teacher salaries in all but one of the nine nearby districts; the Manor district\u2019s average base teacher salary was $46,093.\nOur searches indicated Austin\u2019s average base teacher salary was less than the average base teacher salary in a dozen other urban districts. We looked at the Arlington, North East (Bexar County), Socorro and Ysleta districts in addition to the urban districts shown in the Austin district\u2019s charts. TEA considers these added districts, like the Austin district and others, to be \"major urban\" districts. A district falls into this category if it\u2019s located in a county with a population of at least 840,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged.\nFor another take, we turned to the Texas Association of School Boards, which annually surveys districts on salaries. Spokesman Dax Gonzalez emailed us its findings for 2014-15--and the results, also not folding in Social Security contributions, aligned with the Austin district\u2019s charts in that the least experienced and most experienced Austin teachers had higher salaries than peers in nearby districts--but other teachers trailed. Compared to teachers in the major urban districts that the TEA groups with the Austin district, Austin teachers had lower salaries at all experience levels.\nIn the end, Hinojosa didn\u2019t dispute the range of our findings. Still, she said, \"we have a real problem in this district paying our employees enough.\"","cleaned_claim":"Austin school district teachers are the lowest paid of any urban Texas district and the lowest paid of any surrounding school district.","ambiguity_score":0.012936878,"paraphrases":[["Austin school district teachers are paid less than any other urban Texas district, and less than any district surrounding Austin.",0.0076110717],["Austin school district teachers are among the lowest paid in any urban Texas district and among the lowest paid compared to surrounding school districts.",0.012936878],["The teachers in the Austin school district are paid less than any other urban Texas district, and less than any school district in the surrounding area.",0.0078832489],["The teachers in the Austin school district are paid less than any other urban district in Texas, and less than any surrounding school district.",0.0085877143],["Austin school district teachers are paid less than any other urban Texas district and any surrounding school district.",0.0071787611]]}

There\u2019s no indication that McCarthy\u2019s name is on the list. That\u2019s the first step toward issuing subpoenas that could include the communications of sitting lawmakers.\nRepublican leaders have railed against the committee since it was created, but our focus here is on McCarthy\u2019s assertion that the companies would break a federal law if they complied with a committee subpoena.\nPolitiFact and many other news organizations have asked McCarthy\u2019s office multiple times to name the law he has in mind. So far, there has been no response.\nLegal experts say they don\u2019t know of any law that would do what McCarthy says.\nThe head of the House Republican Study Committee, the policy arm of House GOP leadership, laid out part of the GOP\u2019s legal argument in a letter to the committee. We asked legal experts to assess the key points in that letter as well.\nThe Republican argument\nStudy Committee chair Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said that the Supreme Court has spelled out the limits of the congressional subpoena power. Banks cited the ruling in the case of Trump v. Mazars, when former President Donald Trump fought the release of his tax records by his accounting firm.\n\"A congressional subpoena is valid only if it is \u2018related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of Congress and must serve a valid legislative purpose,\u2019\" Banks wrote Aug. 27.\nBanks said the committee is entitled only to information needed to pass laws and conduct oversight. He made other points, but the requirement for a legislative purpose was central to his case.\nThe Jan. 6 committee\u2019s mandate\nThe resolution creating the select committee gave it a broad investigative scope, and the option to suggest new laws.\nUnder the resolution \u2014 which passed 220-190 on a party-line vote \u2014 the committee was told to look at how campaigns and online platforms, along with other entities, might have motivated the attackers. The resolution named several groups to put under the microscope, but in case it left any out, it expanded the committee\u2019s reach to \"other entities of the public and private sector as determined relevant by the Select Committee.\"\nThat last clause could sweep in members of Congress.\nAs for a legislative purpose, the resolution said the committee could offer \"legislative recommendations as it may deem advisable.\"\nSo the committee\u2019s mandate under the resolution appears to address some of Banks\u2019 arguments about the limits of congressional subpoena authority.\nBut McCarthy\u2019s argument is not about that. It\u2019s about the legal risk companies would face if they agree to turn over records under subpoena. And according to experts we spoke with, his argument is wrong.\nOutside legal views\nThe law professors and a telecommunications lawyer we reached said someone could certainly challenge a committee subpoena in court, but there\u2019s no guarantee they would win.\n\"I suspect a court would give Congress great leeway in deciding what information the body needs for its investigation into the Capitol riot,\" said University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal. \"But it\u2019s certainly possible that the congressional subpoena could be narrowed\" by the court.\nAs for the legal hazard faced by the telecommunication and social media companies, the experts drew a blank.\n\"I don\u2019t see there being a penalty for compliance, even if the subpoena is later deemed unlawful,\" said Ellen Goodman at Rutgers University Law School.\nDavid Alan Sklansky at Stanford Law School echoed that, saying, \"I don't know what McCarthy is talking about.\"\nThere are, however, two sets of legal standards under privacy law for getting access to telecommunications records. A request for \"metadata\" \u2014 information about who sent a message or placed a call, and from where and when \u2014 is subject to less scrutiny than\u00a0 a request for \"content,\" the emails and text messages themselves.\n\"Federal law does protect the privacy of non-content phone records in the hands of the carrier, but if the disclosure is \u2018required by law\u2019 there is no legal prohibition\" against releasing it, said Albert Gidari, a retired lawyer who represented telecommunication companies on these legal matters for over two decades.\nGidari said the process is more demanding for the content. A court-issued warrant or the individual\u2019s consent would be necessary for a company to be authorized to release the messages.\nBut federal law, Gidari said, expressly protects the companies \"for complying with a subpoena or warrant compelling disclosure.\"\n\"I am not aware of any law under which a company would forfeit its \u2018ability to operate in the United States\u2019 for complying with a subpoena to turn over private information,\" he added.\nWe reached out to several companies that the committee contacted. Most did not respond, but Google and Reddit said they are working with the committee. Facebook told other news organizations the same.\nThe companies can\u2019t simply ignore a congressional subpoena. They could face a misdemeanor charge if they did. But they can seek to quash a subpoena and leave it to a court to decide.","cleaned_claim":"If these telecom and internet companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States.","ambiguity_score":0.0330771767,"paraphrases":[["If these telecom and internet companies hand over private information to the Democrats, they will be breaking federal law and could lose their ability to operate in the United States.",0.0231849998],["If telecom and internet companies turn over private information to Democrats, they would be violating federal law and could lose their ability to operate in the United States.",0.0234363526],["If these telecom and internet companies turn over private information to the Democrats, they will be in violation of federal law and could lose their ability to operate in the United States.",0.0330771767],["If telecom and internet companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they could be in violation of federal law and could lose their ability to operate in the United States.",0.0115231788],["If these telecom and internet companies turn over private information to Democrats, they would be violating federal law and could lose their ability to operate in the United States.",0.0292000398]]}

We rate the statement False.","full_article":"A Facebook post from the Jerusalem Prayer Team, an American Christian-Zionist organization\u00a0 says a 1986 prophecy foretold of a plague like COVID-19 hitting New York City.\nThe post says that David Wilkerson, the late founder of the Times Square Church, told Mike Evans, the leading pastor of the Jerusalem Prayer Team, the following:\n\"I see a plague coming on the world and the bars and church and government will shut down. The plague will hit New York City and shake it like it has never been shaken. The plague is going to force prayerless believers into radical prayer and into their Bibles and repentance will be the cry from the man of God in the pulpit. And out of it will come a third Great Awakening that will sweep America and the world.\"\nThere is no evidence that Wilkerson, who died in 2011, actually made this prediction.\nPolitiFact reached out to the Times Square Church, the non-denominational church that Wilkerson established in 1987, and a spokesperson there said, \"The church is not aware of Pastor David ever writing that in any of his books or sermons.\"\nWe did not receive a response to multiple inquiries to the Jerusalem Prayer Team. The Facebook post instructs readers to click on a link, where they can find video, transcript and a prophetic message from Evans as well as the \"entire prophecy from David Wilkerson.\" That page then instructs readers to enter their email address to receive a free speech by Evans where he shares Wilkerson\u2019s prediction.\nThe speech says Evans met Wilkerson for breakfast in 1986 at an Embassy Suites hotel near the Dallas-Fort Worth airport in Texas. There, according to Evans, Wilkerson predicted a plague so strong that it would shut down restaurants and bars in New York City.\nEvans writes that Wilkerson pointed him to the Bible\u2019s Old Testament Book of Isaiah, where it says that \"every house will be shut up, and no one will be coming or going. The city of confusion is broken down, and every house is shut up that no man may come in.\"\nThe book of Isaiah, which Judeo-Christian tradition holds was written by a prophet by the same name, does address a plague that forces people to stay inside and shuts down an economy. But it doesn\u2019t explicitly point to the coronavirus hitting New York City. Chapter 24 is believed to describe the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah due to man\u2019s inability to follow God\u2019s covenant.\nEvans is promoting his new book, \"A Great Awakening is Coming!\" an ad for which appears to have aired on Fox News, and also focuses on this tale of Wilkerson\u2019s prophecy. A video posted April 23 on a YouTube account called \"Mike Evans\" shows the ad airing during \"Fox and Friends.\"\nAs a photograph of Wilkerson appears on screen, a narrator reads the same prophecy that is quoted in the Facebook post. \"Number one New York Times best-selling author Mike Evans has written an astonishing book on it called \u2018A Great Awakening is Coming!\u2019\" it continues. Then it directs viewers to get the book and the full prophecy by going to a website, where they can purchase the book in print, electronic form or in a set with DVDs selling for up to $56.90.\nWilkerson\u2019s claims have faced scrutiny before. In 2009, Snopes.com debunked the claim that he was sent a message from God warning of the terrorist attacks in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001.\nWilkerson had claimed to have been awoken from a dream weeks before planes crashed into the Twin Towers and told by God to prepare sandwiches. He claimed that he and other members of the Times Square Church made over 2,000 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. However, there was no evidence that the sandwiches were actually made prior to the attacks; they were actually made during the day on Sept. 11, after planes had already crashed into the Twin Towers.","cleaned_claim":"In 1986, the founder of the Times Square Church prophesied that he saw a plague coming on the world and the bars and church and government will shut down, with New York City especially hard hit.","ambiguity_score":0.0208939593,"paraphrases":[["In 1986, the founder of the Times Square Church prophesied that he saw a plague coming on the world and that bars, churches, and government buildings would shut down, with New York City being especially hard hit.",0.0148575837],["In 1986, the founder of the Times Square Church prophesied that he saw a plague coming on the world, and that bars, churches, and government institutions would shut down.

Melissa Agard, D-Madison, is on board, issuing a Sept. 2, 2021 news release that hailed the agency for \"acknowledging the stark reality of too many lives lost each day.\"\nShe went on to make this claim:\n\"The fact is, no other country on the planet witnesses the number of gun deaths that we do here in the United States, and it\u2019s not even close.\"\nIs Agard right?\nDigging into the numbers\nWhen asked for backup, Agard\u2019s staff pointed us to various studies examining the level of gun violence in the United States and in other countries, including studies on mass shootings, gun ownership, and the number of children shot and killed.\nFor instance according to a 2017 Pew Research Center study, about four in 10 Americans say they either own a gun or live in a home with guns -- the highest level among the nations surveyed.\nBut Agard\u2019s claim was about gun deaths, not gun ownership.\nAnd the way she phrased it -- flat out most in the world, without any qualifications -- means she is a bit off.\nRaw numbers\nLet\u2019s start with the raw numbers.\nAccording to the World Population Review \"Gun Deaths By Country 2021\" report,\u00a0 Brazil topped the list of the most gun deaths, with a total of 43,200 out of the 250,000 deaths worldwide. The United States had the second-highest number of gun deaths with 37,200.\nThe report noted that in the U.S., mass shootings receive a great deal of media attention, however, they account for a small number of overall gun violence deaths.\nSo, by that measure, Agard is close -- the U.S. ranks second, but is certainly not \"far and away\" in first.\nDeaths by population size\nOf course, countries are of various sizes. So, what about deaths as a proportion of the population?\nThere Agard fares even worse.\nA March 24, 2021 NPR article cited data from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and noted \"the U.S. has the 32nd-highest rate of deaths from gun violence in the world: 3.96 deaths per 100,000 people in 2019.\"\nAt the top of the list were a series of Central and South American countries, starting with El Salvador (36.77 per 100,000), followed by Venezuela (33.27), Guatemala (29.06), Colombia (26.36) and Brazil (21.92 per 100,000.)\nOther high-ranking countries included the Bahamas, Honduras and Mexico.\nResearchers noted that a large factor in gun violence in Central America and the Caribbean is a high level of gangs and drug trafficking. Venezuela, meanwhile, has struggled with political unrest and economic problems.\nThe report, released in 2020, noted that deaths from gun violence can be rare in many low-income countries \u2014 such as Tajikistan and Gambia, which saw 0.18 deaths and 0.22 deaths, respectively, per 100,000 people.\nBut wealthy Asian countries such as Singapore (0.01), Japan (0.02) and South Korea (0.02) have the absolute lowest rates \u2014 along with China, also at 0.02.\nSo, by this measure, Agard is way off.\nDeveloped countries\nWhat happens if you narrow the examination to countries that are larger, or more developed?\nIn a March 2021 article, the University of Washington\u00a0Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation focused strictly on gun homicides (so, not including gun-related suicides) among 64 high-income countries and territories.\nThe U.S. ranked 8th with two U.S. territories -- Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands -- coming in first and third. (Bahamas was second).\nWhen the institute narrowed it further, and looked at high-income countries and territories with populations of 10 million or more, the U.S. did come out on top.\nUnited States 4.12 per 100,000 population\n\n\nChile 1.82\n\n\nCanada 0.5\n\n\nPortugal 0.4\n\n\nItaly 0.35\n\n\nGreece 0.35\n\n\nBelgium 0.34\n\n\nFrance 0.32\n\n\nSweden 0.25\n\n\nNetherlands 0.23\nSo, by this specific measure, the U.S. was on top, and far ahead of the next countries.\nBut, of course, Agard did not specify that measure.

We rate the claim Half True.","full_article":"During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, re-litigated the background of President Barack Obama\u2019s former attorney general, Eric Holder.\nOne of the debate moderators, Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network, asked Cruz for \"the answer\" to stopping mass shootings and violent crime.\n\"The answer is simple,\" he said. \"You prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, (co-debate moderator Neil Cavuto) asked, \u2018What has President Obama done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\"\nWe raised our eyebrows at Cruz\u2019s mention of Holder and what he said. Is Cruz right?\nLet\u2019s go to the videotape from back in 1995, a time when there really were such things as videotapes.\nIn January 1995, Holder -- then the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- gave a speech announcing a plan to curb gun violence in the city of Washington, D.C.\nHere\u2019s a portion of the speech, recorded by C-SPAN.\n\"What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that\u2019s not cool, that it\u2019s not acceptable, it\u2019s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes,\" Holder said. He later added, \"We have to be repetitive about this. It\u2019s not enough to have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it Monday. We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.\"\nSo there\u2019s video proof that Holder did indeed say what Cruz said he did.\nThat said, we\u2019ll offer two caveats.\nFirst, the way Cruz phrased his statement might lead listeners to believe that Holder had talked about \"brainwashing\" during his tenure as attorney general or shortly before he was nominated by Obama for the post. That\u2019s not the case -- the remark in question came a full 14 years earlier.\nSecond, Cruz leaves out the context in which Holder was speaking. As the top federal law enforcement official for the District of Columbia, Holder was speaking at a very particular time about a very particular place.\nAt the time, drug-related crime and gun murders in Washington were a serious concern, both locally and nationally. A few years before, D.C. had been dubbed the \"murder capital of the world.\" In other portions of the speech, Holder can be heard referring specifically to youth violence in the nation\u2019s capital and referencing local officials such as once-and-future mayor Marion Barry.\nThis D.C. focus by Holder is supported by a Jan. 13, 1995, Washington Post article that preceded the speech but which laid out a general overview of Holder\u2019s initiative.\n\"U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. said yesterday he is completing the details of a massive law enforcement effort to get guns off Washington's streets,\" the article says. \"It will target people carrying and selling firearms in the city's most violent neighborhoods.\"\nIn addition to tougher law enforcement, Holder was proposing efforts to change \" \u2018romanticized\u2019 perceptions about guns and violence, especially among young black men.\" Holder -- the first African American to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington -- was planning to unveil the speech on Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday.\n\"As a people, did we fight, did we sacrifice, did we die simply to inherit and then bequeath to our children this kind of America where crimes run rampant and fears stalk our citizens?\" Holder wrote in a draft of the speech, according to the Post.\nHolder told the Post that the goal of the effort was designed to reduce violence in Washington by the end of the decade to levels prior to 1986, when crack cocaine sent homicides and shootings soaring.\n\"I believe that if you can really change the way young people, especially young black men, view the possession and use of guns ... you can have a significant impact on the quality of life in this city,\" Holder told the Post.\nThis is a nuance that Cruz\u2019s statement ignores.","cleaned_claim":"President Barack Obama appointed Eric Holder as attorney general.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., gained newfound clout last week in shaping the nation\u2019s immigration policy. She and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced\u00a0they\u2019d reached a deal with President Trump on protecting the Dreamers.\nThe Dreamers are the 800,000 young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children and temporarily shielded from deportation under the Obama-era DACA program. About one quarter live in California.\nThis week, Pelosi claimed three-quarters of Americans support what she described as the legislative solution for safeguarding Dreamers from deportation: the DREAM Act.\nFirst introduced in 2001, the DREAM Act is a bipartisan bill that would offer protections for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children as long as they meet certain requirements. It would also include a path to citizenship for those who graduate from U.S. high schools and attend college, enter the workforce, or enlist in a military program.\nPelosi made her claim during a speech Sept. 18, 2017 at Sacramento State University:\n\"Seventy-six percent of the American people support us passing the DREAM Act \u2026 with citizenship and legalization as part of it all. \u2026 More than 60 percent of Republicans support that.\"\nWe interpreted the second portion of her statement, about citizenship and legalization, to mean Americans are comfortable with one or the other option, particularly for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.\nGiven the heated debate around immigration, we wanted to know whether such a large share of Americans really support the DREAM Act, or at least the key provisions of the bill.\nWe set out on a fact check.\nOur research\nAs evidence for the claim, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman pointed to a Politico\/Morning Consult poll conducted Aug. 31 through Sept. 3, 2017. The poll includes responses from nearly 2,000 registered voters.\nThe questions didn\u2019t mention the DREAM Act specifically, but instead asked about the main thrust of the legislation.\nHere\u2019s the question that got the closest:\n\"As you may know, Dreamers are young people who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children, often with their parents. Which of the following do you think is the best way to handle Dreamers?\"\n\u2022 58 percent said Dreamers \"should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they meet certain requirements.\"\n\u2022 18 percent said Dreamers \"should be allowed to stay and become legal residents, but NOT citizens, if they meet certain requirements.\"\nCombined, this totals the 76 percent Pelosi cited.\nBacking up her point about Republican support, the poll found 69 percent of Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats surveyed favored one of these two options.\nOther polling\nThe late August poll backs up Pelosi\u2019s claim. But we wanted to know whether other polls had asked similar questions and whether they told a different story.\nKathleen Frankovic, a leading expert on public opinion polling, told us there haven\u2019t been many recent surveys specifically on the DREAM Act. The new version of the bill was only introduced in July 2017.\nShe said in an email that other polling has shown \"general support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\"\nShe cited a September 2017 poll by The Economist\/YouGov in which 69 percent favored either a path to citizenship or legal status when asked \"Which comes closest to your view about illegal immigrants who are living in the U.S.?\" The question did not specifically ask about Dreamers.\nFrankovic cautioned: \"Since wording can affect answers on this subject, politicians can pick and choose the numbers they want to cite, the ones that make the strongest case for their position.\"\nA question in a CNN\/ORC poll from March 2017 offers a more detailed description of the type of immigrant that should be considered for legal status. It results in a higher favorability rating.\nRespondents were asked: \"Now, thinking about how the U.S. government should treat illegal immigrants who have been in this country for a number of years, hold a job, speak English and are willing to pay any back taxes that they owe. Would you favor or oppose a bill that allowed those immigrants to stay in this country rather than being deported and eventually allow them to apply for U.S. citizenship?\nNinety percent said they favored such a bill.\nGallup polls\nThree Gallup polls in recent years show increasing support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n\u2022 A December 2010 Gallup poll found 54 percent of Americans, at that time, supported allowing \"illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to gain legal resident status if they join the military or go to college.\" It found 66 percent of Democrats favored it, while only 34 percent of Republicans backed the idea.\n\u2022 A July 2015 Gallup poll found 65 percent of U.S. adults favored a plan to allow immigrants who were living illegally in the U.S. to remain in the country and become citizens if they met certain requirements over time.\n\u2022 One year later, a July 2016 Gallup poll, found 84 percent of U.S. adults favored that idea. Looking at the parties, 91 percent of Democrats and 76 percent of Republicans supported it.\n\u2022 A previous Politico\/Morning Consult poll from April 2017, found 78 percent of respondents backed the idea of a path to citizenship or legal status under certain requirements.\n\u2022 Explaining his desire to find a legislative solution, President Trump claimed in September 2017 that 92 percent of Americans \"agree on DACA,\" the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. PolitiFact national examined support for the temporary protection program and found high favorability ratings, but not as high as 92 percent.

Mark Kelly said in an Aug. 12 opinion column on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger.\nKelly, a New Jersey native, is married to former Arizona Rep. Gabrille Giffords, a Democrat, who was shot in the head Jan. 8, 2011 during a public appearance at a supermarket parking lot in Tucson, Ariz. Six people were killed and 13 were wounded at the event, including Giffords.\nKelly\u2019s column expressed support for Gov. Chris Christie to sign some gun-control bills passed recently by the state Legislature, and urged Christie to sign another bill that would, in part, expand background checks on gun purchases and safety training for gun owners.\nAs for the high approval ratings in Kelly\u2019s claim, data supports it.\nKelly was referring to a Jan. 24 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., according to Katie Hill, press secretary for Kelly, Giffords and their group Americans for Responsible Solutions.\nThe poll of 1,647 registered voters in New Jersey asked, \"Would you favor or oppose requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows?\"\nThe response, according to poll data: 96 percent favored it. The figure was 95 percent for \u2018gun households,\u2019 meaning those households in New Jersey where a gun is present.\nPia Carusone, executive director of Americans For Responsible Solutions, noted that federal law requires background checks for guns purchased from federally licensed firearms dealers, \"otherwise known as a gun \u00a0store.\" That\u2019s not the case, however, if guns are purchased from a private seller at a gun show \u2013 and the point that Carusone said Kelly was making with his claim.\n\"When we say expanding background checks, we mean to say to cover guns purchased at gun shows,\" Carusone said.\nThe Truth-O-Meter reviewed this issue \u2013 commonly known as the \"gun show loophole\" -- in a May 2012 fact-check. At that time we confirmed that The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun. Private sellers without a federal license don\u2019t have to meet the same requirement, although some states have stricter requirements than others.\nIn addition to the Quinnipiac poll, we checked with other organizations in New Jersey to determine how their post-Newtown gun control polls fared.\nPatrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, said the organization hasn\u2019t done a poll about expanding background checks, but did survey residents earlier this year about whether gun control would influence their vote for governor in November.\nDavid Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University, said an early February poll asked 794 New Jerseyans a variety of questions about guns.\nTwo of six questions asked randomly were background-check related and had approval levels at 90 percent or higher. Approval levels topped 80 percent for the same questions posed to \u2018gun households,\u2019 he said.\nFairleigh Dickinson University\u2019s PublicMind poll in January asked questions about greater restrictions on guns and ammunition, and better management of the mentally ill, according to Krista Jenkins, director of PublicMind and a political science professor at FDU.","cleaned_claim":"Polls show that 96 percent of New Jerseyans \u2013 and 95 percent of gun households in the state \u2013 support expanding background checks to keep guns away from those who shouldn\u2019t have them.","ambiguity_score":0.1073478684,"paraphrases":[["Almost all New Jersey residents (96%) and gun owners (95%) support expanding background checks to keep guns away from dangerous people.",0.0488226339],["A large majority of New Jersey residents (96%) support expanding background checks for gun ownership, including 95% of households that already have guns.

The advisory stated that \"no human-to-human transmission has been reported.\" As a precaution, it advised health officials to wear an \"N95 disposable facepiece respirator\" if they were treating a patient who had recently traveled to Wuhan and was experiencing respiratory problems.\nThe situation summary the CDC posted on Jan. 10 stressed that there were no deaths associated with the novel coronavirus at the time and that the health risk to the American public was low.\nOn Feb. 1, the CDC updated its advisory and noted that there were seven cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. It detailed how doctors and caregivers should avoid being in close contact with patients who might have COVID-19, especially those who had traveled to China or had been in close contact with known cases.\nThe Feb. 28 update from the CDC told doctors to assume that anyone with respiratory symptoms had COVID-19, even if they hadn\u2019t had close contact with other patients or traveled to China recently.\nIt\u2019s hard to put a finger on when Trump \"admitted the coronavirus might be a problem.\"\nRELATED: Timeline: How Donald Trump responded to the coronavirus pandemic\nOn Feb. 27, Trump announced during a press conference that he was putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the Coronavirus Task Force. However, in the same conference, Trump told reporters that he didn\u2019t think a widespread outbreak in the U.S. was inevitable, just that \"there\u2019s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse.\"\nTrump gave an Oval Office address on March 11, the same day the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic, in which he banned travel from Europe for the next 30 days. He also reminded the public that on March 6 he had signed, and Congress had passed, \"an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies.\"\nTrump declared a national emergency on March 13 during a press conference with his Coronavirus Task Force. This opened up $50 billion of funding that would be used to \"fight against this disease.\"","cleaned_claim":"The CDC issued its first warning on Jan 8.

They are substantially explained on the tax returns and financial disclosures that the Bidens made public. Those documents show that the Bidens\u2019 increased income from 2017 to 2019 came mostly from speaking engagements and book deals.\nThis claim takes the Bidens\u2019 reported incomes from 2016-2019 out of context. We rate this claim Half True.","full_article":"When Joe Biden left office in early 2017 after four years as vice president, his finances reflected the salary he earned as a longtime public servant. He and his wife, Jill, a teacher and professor, reported adjusted gross income of just under $400,000 on their joint tax return form in 2016.\nIn the years that followed, though, their adjusted gross income ballooned: to about $11 million in 2017, plus another $5.6 million over 2018 and 2019.\nThe change intrigued social media users. One Facebook post says, \"Joe & Jill Biden\u2019s income went from $396,456 in 2016, to $16,596,979 in 2017-2019. Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?\"\nThe post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It\u2019s among several posts that have tried to raise questions about the sources of the Bidens\u2019 wealth.\nThe post compares a one-year income figure to a combined three years, inflating the difference somewhat. But the figures themselves are right on the money: The Bidens reported earning $396,456 in 2016 and a total of $16,596,979 from 2017 to 2019 \u2014 which includes $11,031,309 in 2017; $4,580,437 in 2018; and $985,233 in 2019.\nBut the big mystery postulated in the claim \u2014 \"Anyone else want to know where that money is coming from?\" \u2014 is not such a big mystery. Many of the answers are detailed in the tax documents the Bidens have made public, which make clear that their big income gain for those years came mostly from fees for speaking engagements and book deals.\nMost of Joe Biden\u2019s paid speeches from late 2017 through mid-2018 were part of a tour promoting his November 2017 book \"Promise Me, Dad,\" a New York Times bestseller about the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer.\nBiden\u2019s book-tour events brought income ranging from a low of $8,000 to one \"VIP experience\" that commanded nearly $235,000 and included preferential seating and a reception, according to his presidential financial disclosure form. Biden earned a total of $1.8 million from 30 book tour events, based on the disclosure. The book sold more than 300,000 copies, Forbes reported.\n\"Promise Me, Dad\" was part of a deal Biden struck with Flatiron Books to write two non-fiction works as well as a third book with Jill Biden, according to Publishers Weekly, which reported that the three-book deal was worth $8 million.\nBesides his book tour, Biden participated in events such as the MPSF Speaker Series in California, where he delivered four speeches around the state for a total of about $500,000, according to the financial disclosure. From late 2017 through July 2019, he had 19 speaking engagements that earned him a total of $2.4 million, the disclosure says.\nThe Bidens\u2019 sources of income from 2017 through summer 2019 also included Jill Biden\u2019s speaking engagements, which brought in about $700,000, and Joe Biden\u2019s job as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, which paid an annual salary of $540,484, according to the disclosure.\nThe money the Bidens earned from book deals and speaking engagements was routed through two S corporations they formed, CelticCapri Corp. and Giacoppa Corp. In his 2019 presidential financial disclosure form, Joe Biden lists $425,000 in salary and $2.8 million in a distributive share from CelticCapri.","cleaned_claim":"Joe & Jill Biden\u2019s income went from $396,456 in 2016, to $16,596,979 in 2017-2019.

There is an instant reaction on Wall Street.\"\nThe Dow fell 14.8% between Obama\u2019s 2008 election and inauguration, so Payne was right about the extent of the drop. The other numbers check out as well.\nMore importantly, experts said the decline was not a crash in and of itself, but instead part of a longer trend resulting from the 2008 financial crisis and issues that had been bubbling for months. The reaction was hardly dramatic or \"instant.\"\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.","full_article":"Fox Business Network host Charles Payne wrongly claimed the market crashed as an \"instant reaction\" to former President Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008.\nDuring a June 17 segment on \"Your World with Neil Cavuto,\" Payne was asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet that his failure to win re-election would cause a major market crash.\n\"I think President Trump was talking about the knee-jerk reaction on Wall Street,\" Payne said. \"All you\u2019ve got to do is look at history.\"\nPayne said the market went up 9% between the day Trump was elected and the day of his inauguration ceremony.\n\"Conversely, when President Obama was elected, the market crashed,\" he said. \"Trump was up 9%, President Obama was down 14.8% and President Bush was down almost 4%. There is an instant reaction on Wall Street.\"\nWe decided to check if Obama\u2019s 2008 victory sent the stock market spiraling and, more generally, if elections do trigger immediate reactions on Wall Street. So we reviewed the numbers and talked to economists.\nPut simply, Payne is right about the market numbers but wrong about what caused them and how fast they happened.\nThe numbers\nSince Payne mentioned the period between Election Day and Inauguration Day, we first focused on that time frame, which for Obama was the window between Nov. 4, 2008, and Jan. 20, 2009.\nWe found that the market did decline following Obama\u2019s election, but it\u2019s important to note that that window of decline was part of a larger trend set off by the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average opened at 9,323.89 on Nov. 4, 2008, and dropped to a low of 7,939.93 by Jan. 20, 2009. That\u2019s a 14.8% decrease, as Payne said. It continued sinking after Obama\u2019s inauguration, hitting its lowest mark on March 6, 2009, at 6,469.95.\nLooking at just Nov. 4 and 5 of 2008, the Dow fell less than 2%, from 9,323.89 to 9,139.27. So there was a slight drop in that time frame, too.\nBut those declines shouldn\u2019t be considered a \"crash,\" experts told us. In reality, the Dow had been slipping since Oct. 9, 2007, when it reached its pre-recession peak at 14,166.97.\nOn Sept. 29, 2008, before Obama\u2019s election, the Dow fell 774.17 points in a single day. Two weeks before that, a declaration of bankruptcy from the financial services firm Lehman Brothers also caused the Dow to drop 498.86 points in a day\u2019s time.\n\"The election of Obama did not cause the global financial crisis,\" said Tara Sinclair, professor of economics at George Washington University. \"The stock market can react strongly to news of all sorts, but the academic research is clear that the seeds of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession were sown well before Obama was elected.\"\nSinclair said the 2008 financial crisis and market crash are generally attributed to \"issues in housing markets and financial interconnectedness that wasn\u2019t foreseen by policymakers.\" (For more on the causes, read our analysis from 2008).\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, Payne defended his use of the word \"crash.\"\n\"When the market declines almost 15% in less than three months, I consider that a crash,\" the Fox Business Network host said. \"I wasn't assigning blame, but the election at the time obviously didn't engender confidence in investors or mitigate concerns about issues at the time.\"\nBut Kathleen Day, professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, said Payne is cherry-picking, since Obama\u2019s presidency eventually saw net stock market gains.\n\"That\u2019s like taking a snapshot on a rainy day,\" she said. \"Let\u2019s look at how many sunny economic days we\u2019ve had over the course of their tenure.\"\nFor the record, the Dow opened at 13,112.90 on Nov. 6, 2012 \u2014 the day Obama was re-elected for a second term in office \u2014 and closed at 13,712.21 on Jan. 22, 2013, the first day the market was open after his second inauguration ceremony. That\u2019s an increase of about 4.6%.\nThe Dow rose 8.6% in the same time frame after Trump\u2019s election in 2016 and fell 3.6% after former President George W. Bush won in 2000 \u2014 so Payne was right on those numbers, also.\nHow sensitive is the market to elections?\nExperts we spoke to were mixed on whether the stock market reacts to presidential election results.\n\"Stock market fluctuations may reflect investors\u2019 hope for the new administration that will take office on Jan. 20,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the nonprofit Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C.\nBut the same market fluctuations could also be the result of other economic factors, such as joblessness, company profitability or economic growth or decline, Burtless said. \"Much of this information may have nothing whatsoever to do with the new administration.\"\nGenerally speaking, experts said it\u2019s hard to explain market movements over a short period of time, such as the window between a president\u2019s election and inauguration.\n\"The stock market is a little bit like a hysterical person on a boat running from one side of the boat to the other and making it tilt that way,\" Day said.\n\"The market is sensitive to elections, yes,\" she said. \"But no one really knows why it goes up or down everyday unless there\u2019s some really catastrophic event.\"\nSinclair, the George Washington University professor, also warned against drawing conclusions from comparisons of the stock market\u2019s performance under different presidents, since each person comes into office facing different conditions. (PolitiFact compared Obama and Trump on the stock market in 2018.)\nComparisons that begin with Election Day are especially unhelpful, Burtless added, because a new president won\u2019t take the reins until after inauguration.\n\"In that period, the newly elected president has no say over any of the policy levers controlled by a president who actually holds office,\" Burtless said.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s also not clear how valuable the stock market is as an indicator of the country\u2019s economic health, let alone a president\u2019s economic decision-making. Not every American invests in the stock market, so it\u2019s probably not the most relevant metric.","cleaned_claim":"When President Obama was elected, the market crashed \u2026 Trump was up 9%, President Obama was down 14.8% and President Bush was down almost 4%.

She never did it. And so, what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough, and he freed 1,000 of these people.\"\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Harris rejected staff recommendations urging her to adopt a \"Brady policy\" in 2005, and that lack of action backfired in 2010 when a scandal broke out and roughly 1,000 drug cases had to be dropped or dismissed. Harris later added such a policy.\nOverall, Biden\u2019s statement is largely accurate but needs a few clarifications, including that there were 1,000 cases dismissed or dropped, not 1,000 prisoners freed.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.","full_article":"Viewers of the Detroit Democratic debates got an encore showdown between former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris when the topic of busing reemerged.\nThis time, Biden tried to turn the tables on Harris for her attacks on his busing record, accusing her of failing to desegregate schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco during her two-term stint as attorney general of California.\nBiden also recalled a scandal that occurred on Harris\u2019s watch while she was district attorney of San Francisco. Biden said:\n\"Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there that, in fact, was abusing people's rights.\n\"And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people, her own staff, that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me that you, in fact, have been \u2014 the police officer did something that did not give you information that would exculpate your client.\n\"She didn't do that. She never did it. And so, what happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough, enough, and he freed 1,000 of these people. If you doubt me, Google \u20181,000 prisoners freed Kamala Harris.\u2019\"\n\"That is simply not true,\" Harris responded.\nSo, who\u2019s right? We followed Biden\u2019s suggestion and Googled away.\nWe found that Biden\u2019s version of events captures the gist of what happened but misses the mark on a few details.\nWhat happened\nA June report from the Wall Street Journal said that in 2005, when Harris was district attorney, her staff encouraged her to adopt a \"Brady policy\" requiring her office\u2019s prosecutors to inform defendants of past misconduct by police and other law enforcement in accordance with Supreme Court precedent.\nBrady policies are named after a 1963 Supreme Court ruling that said prosecutors must turn over all evidence that could potentially exonerate the defendant.\nHarris did not institute such a policy, and in 2010, a crime lab technician in San Francisco was caught stealing drug evidence from the lab for personal use. That meant some lab results had been jeopardized, and more than 1,000 drug cases were dismissed or dropped, according to the Associated Press.\nThe San Francisco Police Department was in charge of running the lab, but a Superior Court judge rebuked Harris and her office for violating defendants\u2019 rights, writing in a scathing decision that Harris \"failed to disclose information that clearly should have been disclosed.\"\nThe judge also wrote that \"individuals at the highest levels of the district attorney\u2019s office\" knew that the technician, who had a criminal record, \"was not a dependable witness at trial.\"\nAs the scandal unfolded, Harris instituted a Brady policy.\nWhat Biden got wrong\nBiden\u2019s account was largely in line with what\u2019s been reported, but he botched a few key details that are worth setting straight.\nFor starters, the scandal resulted in the district attorney\u2019s office dismissing or dropping about 1,000 cases, not \"1,000 prisoners freed,\" as Biden said.\nSecond, Harris eventually implemented a policy mandating the handover of exculpatory evidence, meaning Biden\u2019s claim that \"she never did it\" was not right.\nBiden also mistook the gender and title of the judge who stepped in to reprimand Harris. The judge, Anne-Christine Massullo, presides in the Superior Court of San Francisco County.\nDefending Harris, her campaign told us, \"Harris was not in charge of the crime lab and did not personally see the memo raising issues about the lab technician. Once the issue was brought to her attention, the senator notified defense attorneys and took the extraordinary step of dismissing an estimated 1,000 drug-related cases \u2014 including those of whom had already been convicted and\/or sentenced.\"\nThat argument is countered by the Wall Street Journal, which claims to have reviewed several memos about the issue that Harris\u2019s staff members sent her\u00a0in 2005, as well as a memo \"from the desk of Kamala D. Harris\" that went to top staff members and \"indicated that she had seen the recommendations.\" (PolitiFact could not obtain copies of the memos.)\nHarris also seemed to own up to what happened in a March interview with the Washington Post. \"I take full responsibility,\" she said. \"The buck stops with me.\"","cleaned_claim":"Kamala Harris oversaw a police department that was abusing people\u2019s rights and that she did not disclose to defense attorneys when there was exculpatory evidence: She didn't do that.

Her plan would make Medicare available to all -- all who chose it, that is. The day may come when a Sanders-like plan is viable and politically realistic, but Schrier made clear that since that day is not now, she is focused elsewhere.\nWe rate the claim Mostly False.","full_article":"\"Medicare for All\" is today\u2019s catch phrase for government supported, single-payer health care, and if you\u2019re a free-market Republican, that can sound like a path toward socialism. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician in Washington state who\u2019s running for Congress, uttered that phrase, and Republicans in the other Washington (D.C.) even have it on videotape.\n\"Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system,\" Schrier said.\nThe video clip, with suspenseful music added for emphasis, is part of an ad put out by the National Republican Campaign Committee, or NRCC, an arm of the Republican Party that supports Republicans running for the U.S. House of Representatives. The NRCC supports Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator, in the race for the open seat in Washington\u2019s 8th Congressional District, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs across the Cascades.\nMedicare for All, the Republican ad says, would mean \"your employer-based health coverage\" would be \"eliminated. Your income tax could double. Kim Schrier\u2019s plan will put your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats and require historic tax increases for Washington families. Washington can\u2019t afford Kim Schrier in Congress.\"\nWe could approach this by asking whether \"Medicare for All\" would do this, as we\u2019ll do briefly. But another question arises: Does Schrier really have a plan like this? Let\u2019s see.\nDefinitions\nMedicare for All can mean different things. In its broadest sense, it means that the country would get rid of the current system of multiple health insurers vying for your or your employer\u2019s premiums. Instead, the government would build on an existing\u00a0taxpayer-supported system: Medicare, the federal program that already covers seniors age 65 and older.\nIt does not mean the government would pick your doctor or hospital. Instead, the government would set or negotiate payment rates to providers, and you\u2019d go to the doctor of your choice. The costs and many other details for such a system are in debate, with critics saying that even a doubling\u00a0of all individual and corporate income taxes would be insufficient.\nSupporters say the savings in health care premiums and administrative costs would balance this out, and one proposed bill in the House\u00a0\u2014 a bill with 123 co-sponsors, all Democrats \u2014\u00a0would raise taxes on the incomes of the top 5 percent of earners and on stock and bond transactions. (For a fuller look at this, check out PolitiFact\u2019s annotated checks of an op-ed by President Donald Trump, who called Medicare for All part of Democrats\u2019 \"radical agenda.\")\nBut there are variations on this idea within Congress. One set of proposals would let you or your employer keep the insurance you have but, alternatively, let you buy coverage in the Medicare system if you wanted. Another set of proposals would only open Medicare to individuals and small employers, keeping large-employer insurance largely unchanged. And yet another would allow Medicare buy-in only to people age 50 or 55.\nEach one of these variations has been introduced in Congress. The Kaiser Family Foundation has a handy side-by-side comparison of eight of these bills.\nWhat Schrier wants\nOn her campaign website, Schrier says \"quality health care is a fundamental human right,\" and that is why she says she wants Medicare for All \u2014 but not yet. It will take time, she says, because it will take a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass, and then more time to implement.\nFor now, she says, Congress should allow a voluntary buy-in.\n\"Too many Washingtonians face skyrocketing healthcare costs, and we need to take immediate steps to help them get the coverage they need and deserve,\" her website says. \"That\u2019s why I am committed to moving us toward a Medicare for All system that guarantees affordable, high-quality care for every American. Medicare has proven to be the most cost-efficient way to deliver high-quality care.\n\"But we cannot simply wait for a Democratic president and Democratic majorities in Congress to pass a bill that will take years to implement. In the meantime, we need to take immediate action to stabilize our insurance market and build on the ACA (Affordable Care Act) in the short term and implement a Medicare public option immediately, as we work toward a universal system.\"\nSchrier\u2019s Medicare buy-in would be handled through state health care exchanges -- the Affordable Care Act marketplaces -- with private individual and small-group plans offered as well. Prices would be based on a sliding scale, with subsidies available for the neediest.\nTale of the tape\nThe video clip in the NRCC ad comes directly from Schrier\u2019s campaign website\u2019s video. But there are major differences. The NRCC added scary music and cut off Schrier right after she said, \"Look, ultimately I think we do need to go to a Medicare for All system.\"\nThe full video is more than 12 minutes long. And right after mentioning Medicare for All, Schrier says, \"But I see patients and what they are going through, and we do not have the luxury of waiting until we have a Democratic Congress, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president to get Medicare for All. We need to take action right away.\" She then lays out her \"buy-in, public option\" plan.\nSo on what does the NRCC base its claim that Schrier would eliminate your employer coverage, put \"your health care in the hands of government bureaucrats\" and require \"historic tax increases?\"\nThe ad gives citations on the screen.\nThe part about employer coverage cites a 2017 New York Times analysis on the proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for single-payer health care. \"The employer-based insurance that now covers 156 million people would be eliminated,\" the Times story said. \"Those people would lose their current coverage and be enrolled in the new program instead.\"\n\n\nFor the possible doubling of taxes, the screen cites an Associated Press story from July, which said, \"Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 plan would boost government health spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring historic tax hikes, says a study released Monday by a university-based libertarian policy center.\" This is a study from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Sanders disputes the high-end cost. The New York Times\u2019 and other analyses have said there would be trade-offs, because people could spend less on health care and premiums.\n\n\nAs for the government\u2019s control, the ad\u2019s screen cites a July story in The Hill. The article was about comments from Seema Verma, Trump\u2019s administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs Medicare. \"By choosing a socialized system, you are giving the government complete control over the decisions pertaining to your care or whether you receive care at all,\" Verma said in a speech in San Francisco, as the article reported.\nNot her plan\nThe NRCC\u2019s claims about Schrier assume she wants a Medicare for All program similar to the one promoted by Sanders and a number of House members. Schrier doesn\u2019t specify anyone\u2019s single proposal but says Medicare for All is desirable in the long term -- but unrealistic for now.\nSo when would she want it?\nWe asked her campaign, and spokeswoman Katie Rodihan answered without giving a date because, she said, Schrier isn\u2019t even promoting that kind of plan. \"Dr. Schrier's plan specifically does not eliminate employer-based coverage, does not require an income tax increase, does not give the government \u2018complete control,\u2019 and does not require historic tax increases,\" Rodihan said in an email.\nShe added that the bill the ad seems to cite \"is Bernie Sanders' plan, not Kim Schrier's,\" and that \"Kim does not\" support it. \"The fact is that Kim has her own plan that is separate and distinct from Medicare for All.\"","cleaned_claim":"Washington\u2019s Kim Schrier has a plan to eliminate employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes and put your care in the hands of government bureaucrats.","ambiguity_score":0.7833687067,"paraphrases":[["Kim Schrier, a Washington representative, has a plan to get rid of employer-provided health coverage, increase income taxes by two times, and let government officials manage your healthcare.",0.4696125388],["Kim Schrier of Washington has a plan to eliminate employer-provided health coverage and double income taxes, and to put your care in the hands of government bureaucrats.",0.2781488001],["Washington's Kim Schrier has a plan to get rid of employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes, and put your healthcare in the hands of government bureaucrats.",0.0274440162],["Kim Schrier of Washington has a plan to do away with employer-provided health coverage, double income taxes, and put your healthcare in the hands of government bureaucrats.",0.3399797678],["Kim Schrier, a politician from Washington, has a plan to get rid of employer-provided health coverage, and to instead have the government provide healthcare.

We rate this statement Mostly False.","full_article":"When Hurricane Hermine hit Florida in 2016, it knocked out power for several days in Tallahassee, igniting a political storm of tension between the capital city and state government.\nA new storm is brewing in the 2018 race for governor, with Democratic Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum under attack about allegations his administration didn\u2019t cooperate with utility companies.\n\"After the Hurricane, we had no electricity for over a week,\" said a woman named Kathryn in a TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida. \"Utility companies lined up trucks to restore power. But as mayor, Andrew Gillum refused help from workers. The trucks just sat, while people suffered.\"\n\"Incompetence, or extreme politics, I don't know,\" she says. \"But leaders are supposed to help people in tough times. And Andrew Gillum, he didn't help us. He failed us.\"\nA second TV ad by the party said, \"Gillum turned away workers who could have restored our power.\" Gillum\u2019s Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, has also criticized Gillum\u2019s leadership during the hurricane.\nThis ad distorts the city\u2019s response to the massive power outage. The city accepted help from several utilities, although it turned down an offer of help from Florida Power and Light, the Florida utility giant.\nCity response following Hurricane Hermine\nAfter Hurricane Hermine hit Sept. 1, 2016, more than 75,000 customers of the city's municipal electric system and 20,000 customers of the nearby cooperative electric company, Talquin Electric, lost power. Power was restored to 90 percent of homes within five days.\nAfter the storm hit, Gov. Rick Scott held meetings with government officials, and utility executives including Eric Silagy, Florida Power and Light CEO. Silagy said he had 575 personnel ready to help.\nBut Rob McGarrah, the city\u2019s general manager of utilities, was confident the city had engaged enough assistance from eight other utilities, the Tampa Bay Times\/Miami Herald reported after the storm. He did not immediately jump on the offer by FPL and told Scott that coordination with the visiting crews was important to \"make sure what we're doing is safe.\"\nCity spokeswoman Alison Faris told PolitiFact that at the time FPL\u2019s offer was extended, the city had already accepted all the assistance it could safely utilize.\nBarry Moline was the head of the Florida Municipal Electrical Association at the time. He said it was McGarrah\u2019s responsibility to identify the needs while Moline was in charge of coordinating with other utilities.\n\"Any claim that suggests the mayor had anything to do with rejecting crews is a flat-out lie,\" Moline, who now serves as executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association, told the Sun Sentinel. \"It's wrong. It's false. It didn't happen. The mayor wasn't involved with selecting or choosing crews to bring into Tallahassee.\"\nA few weeks after the storm, the Tallahassee Democrat wrote that Moline and others said \"Mayor Gillum had until 10 p.m. to accept the workers parked 90 minutes away in Lake City or they'd move up the coast.\"\nBut Moline told PolitiFact that it was up to McGarrah, not Gillum, about whether to accept help from various utilities.\nWhen responding to a disaster, the mayor and city commissioners look to McGarrah as the expert, Moline said.\nMoline said at the time FPL was offering \"resources\" but \"they refused to divulge what FPL resources meant\" in terms of the type of workers. Moline said it's important to know what type of workers a utility is offering to provide because workers have different skills.\nFPL media relations didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe images of utility trucks in the ad were from FPL staging areas in Valdosta, Ga., and Flagler, on Florida\u2019s east coast. The names of the company on the trucks were blurred in the ad \"because it was a political ad and the name of the utility company was not relevant, the fact that they were staged and ready and not allowed to help is,\" said Meredith Beatrice, spokeswoman for the Republican Party of Florida.\nOn Sept. 4, Gulf Power sent 150 workers to Leon County.\nDays after the storm, city officials said they accepted all the help they could. McGarrah explained he had to embed his own people in outside crews for safety reasons and that the city had reached a \"saturation point\" with mutual-aid crews.\n\"It starts to get to the point where more bodies don't necessarily equate to ... more productivity,\" he said. \"You can only get so many line trucks, bucket trucks and people in an area.\"\nSeveral news articles following the storm, as well as a report by Leon County, show that the city did accept help from many other utilities.\nLeon County\u2019s report said that the city of Tallahassee Utilities and Talquin Electric both have mutual-aid agreements to obtain equipment and labor from other utilities following disasters. A total of 198 line crews and staff from nine utilities assisted with restoration efforts.\nCrews arrived in Leon County by midday on Friday, Sept. 2, and assisted until Sept. 11, the county report said.\nThe mayor\u2019s role\nCity residents complained on social media about the pace of restoration after word spread that the city turned down help from Florida Power and Light.\nThree days after the storm hit, Gillum defended the city\u2019s response on Facebook.\n\"Let me be clear. We are happy to accept any help from any person or organization that is going to accelerate the speed at which we can safely restore power to our residents. ... We have accepted help from eight different utility companies from three different states offering assistance with power restoration.\"\nGillum warned \"too much help at one time may make us feel better, but it can actually slow down progress.\"\nGillum, however, acknowledged the city could do better at updating planning protocols.\nMoline told the Tampa Bay Times\/Miami Herald that while Gillum was at the meetings about storm response, Tallahassee isn\u2019t a \"strong mayor\" form of government and Gillum \"had zero input into the decisions to get more resources or fewer resources.\"\nBeatrice, the Republican Party spokeswoman, pushed back on that assessment.\n\"He was at those meetings where decisions were made, and he had \u2018zero input,\u2019 which is unacceptable leadership,\" she said. \"The blame still falls on him for not speaking up. Doing nothing and shifting blame to subordinates is awful leadership.\"\nAlan Harris, chief administrator for the Seminole County Office of Emergency Management, told PolitiFact that it sounded like the city followed the mutual-aid agreement in place.\n\"The elected officials do not get involved with the agreements accept to approve them at a board meeting,\" he told PolitiFact.\nTypically, he said, tactical decisions are left in the hands of a department manager, not a mayor or elected official.\nChuck Lanza, a former Broward County emergency management director, said the role of the mayor can depend on the mayor and the situation -- not necessarily the form of government.\n\"Yes, Tallahassee Mayor Gillum is not a \u2018strong mayor,\u2019 as the city has implemented the City Manager model for day-to-day governance,\" Lanza said. \"Having said that, I would not be surprised to see any mayor become the face and voice of the city during a threat and in the subsequent response and recovery. The dynamics are not always documented but the mayor\u2019s power may increase due to the nature of the event. In the old days, the mayor of Miami Beach would have a very visible role in a hurricane response and was successful in making decisions in conflict with the county who had the legal authority to make the decisions.\"","cleaned_claim":"After Hurricane Hermine struck Tallahassee, utility companies lined up trucks to restore power.

In other words, it\u2019s more likely a case of clumsiness, rather coziness with Russian oligarchs \u2014 as Senate Democrats suggest.\nWe rate this Half True.","full_article":"Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.\nThe sanctions relief requires the Russian billionaire, who has ties to President Vladimir Putin, to divest himself of large corporate ownership stakes, including a controlling interest in the world\u2019s second largest aluminium production company, Rusal.\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Democrat, expressed skepticism about the administration's proposal during an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to force a vote against the sanctions relief shortly.\nWarner said the Treasury Department has \"a scheme to try to take (Deripaska\u2019s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45\" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. But he doubted the arrangement would curb Deripaska\u2019s influence.\n\"As more and more of this information comes out about ties between Trump and Trump officials and the Russians,\" Warner said, \"it is the worst time to signal that we're going to take the pressure off of oligarchs like Deripaska.\"\nWarner\u2019s partial description of the Treasury Department\u2019s deal with Deripaska is right, but it leaves out important details. Furthermore, several experts we spoke to had a different read of the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s reasons for wanting the sanctions lifted. We asked Warner's office for comment, but didn't hear back.\nPunishing Russia\nWarner was right about some of the mechanics of the Treasury Department\u2019s deal with Deripaska.\nHere\u2019s the quick backstory on the sanctions. Last April, the Treasury Department placed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, as well as a dozen companies the oligarchs either owned or controlled.\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC \u2014 the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions arm \u2014 said in a report that \"the action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites that further the Kremlin's global malign activities.\" The misbehavior included \"attempts to subvert Western democracy, support for the (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad regime, malicious cyber activities, occupation of Crimea, and instigation of violence in Ukraine.\"\nAmong the dozen sanctioned companies were three that were connected to Deripaska, who the Treasury Department referred to as \"a Kremlin insider.\" Deripaska held a 70 percent ownership stake in EN+, the holding company for the aluminum powerhouse Rusal, and energy company ESE.\nThe department agreed to lift sanctions on the three companies in exchange for Deripaska\u2019s ownership stake in EN+ dropping from 70 to 44.95 percent. Doing so clears a key threshold. With Deripaska no longer the majority owner, the company becomes eligible to have sanctions lifted under the Treasury Department\u2019s \"50-percent rule,\" a process known as delisting.\nBut the deal tacks on additional conditions that Warner didn\u2019t mention. It includes a corporate restructuring, designed to limit Deripaska\u2019s (and Kremlin) influence over the companies, plus additional reporting and transparency requirements.\nUnless lawmakers block it, the sanctions are due to be lifted very soon, by Jan. 18. While this would relieve some of the economic pain inflicted on Deripaska\u2019s companies, it\u2019s worth noting that the sanctions on Deripaska personally would remain in effect.\n\"Deripaska won't see a penny of the income from the shares until he himself is delisted \u2014 and that is not in the cards with this divestiture deal,\" said Samantha Sultoon, a visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\nMost of the foreign policy experts we talked to \u2014 though not all \u2014 shared Warner\u2019s skepticism that the corporate reshuffling plan would keep Deripaska in check.\n\"Given how business is done by influential, Kremlin-connected oligarchs in Russia, I have no question that if Deripaska wants to be in control, he will be,\" said Joseph DeThomas, a former high-ranking State Department official who teaches international affairs at Penn State University.\nCoziness or clumsiness?\nWarner is among a group of Democrats who have raised questions about the Trump administration\u2019s motives for granting sanctions relief to the Deripaska-linked companies, which they see as helping out a Putin crony.\nHowever, most experts we spoke to said this is a case of the Trump administration\u2019s clumsiness, not coziness.\nBack in April, when the sanctions hit the aluminum giant Rusal, it sent shockwaves through the global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared over the following weeks. Europe, which relies heavily on Russia\u2019s metals market, faced the prospect of plant closures and lost jobs. Even now, the European Union strongly supports the lifting of sanctions.\nThe move also disrupted Rusal\u2019s global supply chain. According to the Treasury Department, Rusal subsidiaries in the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and elsewhere \"faced imminent closure,\" before the Treasury stepped in to mitigate some of the damage.\nAccording to experts, the Treasury discovered it had bitten off more than it could chew.\n\"They were done clumsily,\" Alina Polyakova, of the Brookings Institution, said of the sanctions. \"It seems clear that the administration did not plan for the dramatic effects on aluminum markets and the knock-on effects on European businesses.\"\nWarner himself acknowledged this aspect, saying, \"I know there's concerns from our European allies about these sanctions.\" That seems to undercut Senate Democrats\u2019 suggestion that sanctions-relief is a sign of undue coziness between team Trump and Russian oligarchs.\nStill, in the midst of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Moscow, the optics of the sanctions relief plan are not good. \"The Treasury was in a hopeless situation and does not want to state clearly that they made a mistake,\" said Anders \u00c5slund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"Therefore they now look as if they are helping Deripaska.\"","cleaned_claim":"The Trump administration has a scheme to try to take Oleg Deripaska\u2019s ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45 so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions.","ambiguity_score":0.2145185918,"paraphrases":[["The Trump administration is working on a plan to reduce Oleg Deripaska's ownership stake in his Russian company to below 50%, which would remove it from sanctions.",0.1712978333],["The Trump administration is working on a plan to reduce Oleg Deripaska's ownership stake in his Russian company from 70 percent to around 40 or 45 percent.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nWe found that the politician did conduct the test on a kit meant for testing blood samples for the presence of COVID-19 antibodies, and he said it yielded a positive result. But Dialab, the Austrian company that makes the rapid tests, said that happened because Schnedlitz didn\u2019t handle or execute the test properly. Guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for similar rapid tests supports Dialab\u2019s explanation.\nSchnedlitz\u2019s test\nSchnedlitz posted a video on his Facebook page showing him dabbing a swab into a glass with a dark liquid and then gently tapping that swab on a COVID-19 rapid test device. Minutes later, he lifts the testing device and says that there is a positive result (according to YouTube\u2019s auto-generated English captions of his speech in German).\nThe caption for the Dec. 10 video (translated from German to English by Facebook) said: \"Today I did a corona test live in Parliament. The corona mass tests are worthless! This also showed a simple experiment in Parliament where a Coke got a positive result!\" Schnedlitz\u2019 post argued that the government was wasting taxpayer money on the tests.\n\"Today I proved in Parliament how moronic the government's corona mass tests are,\" Schnedlitz said in a follow-up Facebook post, according to the translated version.\nDialab says Schnedlitz did the test wrong\nWhile Schnedlitz may have gotten a positive result, his conclusion about the tests isn\u2019t supported, Dialab said, because his method was wrong. Had the test been conducted properly, the result would have been negative, Dialab said in a Facebook post, according to Facebook\u2019s German to English translation.\nOne error Schnedlitz made is that he did not add a buffer to the Coke \"sample\" before testing it. \"In a properly executed test, the sample is always swirled first in a liquid (buffer) that keeps the pH constant,\" the company wrote.\nCOVID-19 tests should also be conducted by hospital staff or people trained to administer them, Dialab said. Dialab\u2019s Facebook post included a video of a test on a sample of Coke \u2014 treated first with a buffer \u2014 and it yielded a negative result.\nDialab on its website lists its COVID-19 testing products, including the type used by Schnedlitz. That type of test seeks to detect COVID-19 IgG and IgM antibodies in serum, plasma or whole blood samples.\nPolitiFact reviewed instructions for some COVID-19 IgG and IgM rapid tests that have been given emergency use authorization by the FDA in the United States. Those instructions call for the use of a buffer in the testing procedure. That aligns with Dialab\u2019s explanation of how its test works.","cleaned_claim":"An Austrian politician exposed the defectiveness of the government\u2019s Covid-19 tests by demonstrating how even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for Covid-19.","ambiguity_score":0.4336683452,"paraphrases":[["An Austrian politician has demonstrated that the government's Covid-19 tests are not reliable, by showing that even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for the virus.",0.2062283754],["An Austrian politician has revealed that the government's Covid-19 tests are ineffective, by showing that even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for the virus.",0.4336683452],["An Austrian politician showed how the government's Covid-19 tests are not reliable, by demonstrating that even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for Covid-19.",0.0162432436],["An Austrian politician recently showed that the government's Covid-19 tests are not reliable, by demonstrating that even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for the virus.",0.1545041203],["An Austrian politician demonstrated how even a glass of Coca Cola will test positive for Covid-19, exposing the defectiveness of the government's Covid-19 tests.",0.0084403856]]}

We applied the same test to Strickland\u2019s campaign rhetoric.\nPortman has an affiliated super PAC, meaning it\u2019s dedicated solely to supporting him and opposing Strickland. Fighting for Ohio (though it\u2019s registered in Alexandria, Va.) has spent more than $1.68 million against Strickland so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nTop contributors to Fighting for Ohio include Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel ($250,000); Paul Singer, hedge fund manager of Elliott Management Corporation ($250,000); Edyth Lindner, widow of Carl Lindner, former owner of the Cincinnati Reds and Chiquita Brands ($100,000).\nYes, Portman is funded by billionaires. But Strickland\u2019s appeal for cash neglects to mention how he also benefits from outside spending.\nSenate Majority PAC is an unaffiliated funder that pledges its support to Democrats running for the Senate. The PAC mostly pays for TV and digital attack ads against Republican candidates. In this election season, the PAC has lasered in on four major Senate battlegrounds: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio.\nDonors to the Senate Majority PAC include George Marcus, real estate broker at Marcus & Millichap ($1 million); Fred Eychaner, Newsweb Corporation founder ($1 million); and actor\/director\u00a0Seth MacFarlane\u00a0($500,000).\nAnyone can register an unaffiliated super PAC with the Federal Election Commission. This means even if the Senate Majority PAC\u2019s love for Strickland was unrequited, there\u2019s not much Strickland can do about it.\u00a0It\u2019s illegal for a candidate to coordinate with a super PAC, according to the Federal Election Commission rules. But such rules are rarely enforced\u00a0\u2014\u00a0since 1999, commissioners have only launched three investigations on candidate-super PAC contact.\nUnlike Sanders, who filed a cease-and-desist order against a PAC backing him, Strickland hasn't disavowed the\u00a0$1.75 million that the Senate Majority PAC has\u00a0spent\u00a0so far on the race\u00a0targeting\u00a0Portman.

Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in a statement that the goal was to arm the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces \"who are a critical partner in the fight against ISIS.\"\nThe Obama administration urged the Senate to reject the amendment, and Defense Secretary Ash Carter wrote a letter saying it could push the government of Iraq closer to Iran, Politico wrote.\nOn June 18, Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill, which passed the Senate by 71-25 about a month after the bill passed the House.\nThe ad omits that Rubio voted for the defense bill, and that Cruz voted against it.\nCruz said that although the bill will \"increase military readiness,\" he said he could not vote for the bill because he promised, \"I would not vote for an NDAA that continued to allow the president to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by indefinitely detaining them without due process.\"\nThe rest of Rubio\u2019s skipped votes were after the bill passed the Senate.\nObama vetoed the bill on Oct. 22 in part because it prohibited funds to close Guantanamo Bay, one of his 2008 campaign promises.\nBut after Obama signed a two-year budget deal, he signed the defense authorization bill on Nov. 25.\nIs it misleading to attack Rubio for missing 18 votes when they are the same bill?\n\"On the 18 votes, it is sort of fair, although of course not quite the same severity in terms of negligence of missing votes on 18 separate bills,\" said Norm Ornstein, political scientist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"But the vast majority of the votes were on important things, and it is a key bill that is right in Rubio's self-proclaimed wheelhouse, so I see it as fair game.\"\nWe sent a summary of our findings to Rubio\u2019s spokespersons and did not get a reply.","cleaned_claim":"Marco Rubio skipped 18 defense votes including one to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.","ambiguity_score":0.5359004736,"paraphrases":[["Marco Rubio missed 18 votes on defense-related bills, including one that would have authorized arming the Kurds to fight ISIS.",0.4701916277],["Marco Rubio missed 18 votes related to defense, including a vote to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.",0.0154552879],["Marco Rubio missed 18 votes on defense bills, including one that would have armed the Kurds to fight ISIS.",0.5359004736],["Marco Rubio missed 18 votes on defense issues, including one vote to arm the Kurds to fight ISIS.",0.0206612796]]}

Scarborough pushed a bit too far on two points.\nClinton had no direct role in sending the memo, even though it went out under her name. And while the memo encouraged staffers to avoid using personal email accounts, it fell short of prohibiting their use.\nThese points diminish the accuracy of Scarborough\u2019s statement, but not critically.\nWe rate the claim Mostly True.\nUpdate:We\u2019ve added some additional context provided by Clinton at her March 10, 2015, U.N. press conference.","full_article":"The furor over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails during her time as secretary of state has only grown since the New York Times reported she used a personal account for official business. At a press conference at the United Nations March 10, 2015, Clinton said she wished she had handled her email differently but that she complied with federal rules.\u00a0Clinton\u2019s office has turned over more than 55,000 pages of emails and documents to the State Department for review and ultimately some type of public release. Meanwhile, details on those government rules concerning email continue to emerge.\nJoe Scarborough latched on to one recent disclosure -- a 2011 State Department memo that went out under Clinton\u2019s name.\n\"She sent out a memo that says ... you should not do State Department business on personal email,\" Scarborough said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe on March, 9, 2015. \"She sent that memo out to every employee at the State Department.\"\nFor this fact-check, we wanted to dig into the details of Scarborough\u2019s claim that Clinton sent this sort of memo across the entire department.\nScarborough\u2019s staff sent us links to several articles. Fox News posted the actual memo dated June 28, 2011. It was sent to diplomatic and consular staff worldwide in response to a warning from Google that hackers had targeted the Gmail addresses of government workers.\nIt began with \"Department of State users are encouraged to check the security settings and change passwords on their home email accounts because of recent targeting of personal email accounts by online adversaries.\"\nUnder the heading\u00a0\"What can you and your family members do?\" the memo covered such familiar steps as changing your password and making sure you choose a strong one. It also said, \"Avoid conducting official Department business from your personal email accounts.\"\nThis memo had a bit of history. In 2005, a department manual covered transmitting information that is \"sensitive but unclassified.\" That is a broad category that covers anything from meeting schedules, to visa applications, to ordinary emails to other federal agencies. The manual basically said that department-related email should go through servers authorized by the department.\nAs a point of reference, we don\u2019t know if the State Department had signed off on the private server that carried Clinton\u2019s emails (she didn\u2019t use Gmail or Yahoo! or another commercial provider) or if the server met government security standards.\nCaveats to Scarborough\u2019s claim\nScarborough twice said Clinton sent the memo, which ascribes a more personal touch than was actually the case. In the strictest literal sense, Clinton neither wrote nor sent the memo in question. In a March 6 briefing, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said this was a routine memo, or cable.\n\"Her name is at the bottom of the cable, as is practice for cables coming from Washington,\" Harf said. \"Some people think she wrote it -- which is not accurate.\"\nSteven Aftergood directs the project on government secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, a group that promotes transparency in government.\n\"It seems unlikely that the secretary of state would have written or even seen this kind of housekeeping memo,\" Aftergood told PunditFact.\n\"Still, it went out over her name and she is in some sense responsible for it,\" he said.\nScarborough also summarized the memo as saying \"you should not do State Department business on personal email.\"\nThat is a bit off target. There\u2019s a difference between a guideline and a requirement. The memo itself makes the distinction, Aftergood said.\nIn the list of things staffers can do, the final point used stronger language. It said, \"Do not auto-forward department email to personal email accounts, which is prohibited by department policy.\"\n\"It's interesting that the memo says that employees should \u2018avoid\u2019 conducting official business via personal email, but it says that auto-forwarding department email to a private account is \u2018prohibited\u2019,\" Aftergood said. \"The clear implication is that use of personal email for conducting official business is discouraged, but not strictly prohibited.\"\nIn that light, Scarborough's term \"should\" goes a little further than the memo.\nSecurity vs. retaining records\nClinton was secretary of state before there was a law that would have required her to use a government email address or share copies of her communications with the government. That came in 2014.\nTwo significant topics remain unresolved. First, it would make a difference if any of her emails contain classified information. We don\u2019t know if they do.\nSecond, there is a long-standing state department policy on using email for sensitive but unclassified information. That policy speaks to the need to send email through a server that meets department standards. At her U.N. press conference, Clinton said the server she used was set up for former President Bill Clinton\u2019s office and that it had \"numerous safeguards.\" That said, we don\u2019t know the security protections in place on that server.\nIf that server passed muster by government standards, security would not be as important as concerns over retaining official records and ensuring full access to Clinton\u2019s emails during her time as secretary.","cleaned_claim":"Hillary Clinton sent a memo to all State Department staff that said you should not do State Department business on personal email.","ambiguity_score":0.025252888,"paraphrases":[["Hillary Clinton sent a memo to all State Department staff reminding them that they should not use personal email accounts for State Department business.",0.025252888],["Hillary Clinton told all State Department employees that they should not use personal email to do State Department work.",0.0111934161],["Hillary Clinton told all State Department employees not to do State Department business on their personal email accounts.",0.0096556144],["In a memo to all State Department staff, Hillary Clinton said that State Department business should not be conducted on personal email accounts.",0.0113484552],["In a memo to all State Department staff, Hillary Clinton said that department business should not be conducted using personal email.",0.0093302652]]}

Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","full_article":"Before Independence Day, a Texas leader said the federal government needs permission to plant a park in the state. Glenn Hegar, the state comptroller, said in a June 24, 2015, tweet: \"Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!\"\nTwo national parks are in West Texas and the Padre Island National Seashore is on South Padre Island. Also in Texas at the time Hegar tweeted, the U.S. National Park Service listed a national preserve, a national monument, two national historical trails, two national recreation areas, three national historical parks, a national monument, a national memorial, a national preserve and a designated wild and scenic river in the state (all there before another monument, the Waco Mammoth Site, was announced after Hegar exclaimed).\nWe noticed too that a park service web page displays the remarkably brief American Antiquities Act of 1906, signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt. That law authorizes a president to declare national monuments on lands owned or controlled by the federal government. The act states that \"when such objects are situated upon a tract covered by a bona fide unperfected claim or held in private ownership, the tract, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the proper care and management of the object, may be relinquished to the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to accept the relinquishment of such tracts in behalf of the Government of the United States.\"\nSo land can be given up for a park or such, per the act. But there\u2019s nothing about seeking permission from a state.\nHegar\u2019s statement also intrigued us because of how little land the federal government owns in Texas. In August 2014, an advocate with the Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities pointed us toward a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas but far more land in western states that as a condition of joining the union had agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries.\nHegar\u2019s backup\nTo our inquiry about Hegar's tweet, Liz White of his campaign operation said Hegar reached his conclusion starting from a Random Facts website that included this entry: \"Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal government wants to create a park or cut a stand of timber, it must first ask the state\u2019s permission.\"\nOn the site, a footnote attributed the \"permission\" statement to a 2003 book, \"Texas: Facts and Symbols,\" which we found in the children\u2019s section of a branch of the Austin Public Library. The 24-page book presents various facts (as in: Texas got its name from the Caddo word tejas [TAY-hawss]). But it lacks mention of Texas owning its public lands or the federal government needing the state\u2019s permission to create a park.\nIn her email to us, White suggested Hegar\u2019s statement also was supported by a report by the Texas General Land Office, an agency that's been around since before Texas\u2019s statehood; it lately oversees more than 13 million acres of land generating money for Texas public schools.\nThe cited report, last updated in January 2015, states that before statehood, Texas in 1844:\n\"submitted a treaty of annexation to the United States Congress. Under its terms, Texas would have given 175,000,000 acres of public land to the United States government and the United States would have assumed Texas's debts of $10,000,000. The United States Congress rejected the treaty on grounds that the Texas public domain was not worth $10,000,000. When Texas was annexed to the United States in 1845 by a joint resolution of Congress, Texas retained both its debts and its public land. Texas was the only state, other than the original 13 colonies, to enter the Union with control over its public land\u2026 Today, over 22.5 million acres of land remain in the Texas public domain.\"\nSo Texas kept its public lands at statehood.\nWhite also pointed out a federal park service web page on the Big Bend park, which she described as demonstrating the federal government asked permission from the state to acquire land for a park. The cited passage:\n\"In the 1930's many people who loved the Big Bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. The State of Texas passed legislation to acquire land in the area which was to become the Texas Canyons State Park. In 1935, the Federal Government passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park. The State of Texas deeded the land that they had acquired to the Federal government, and on June 12, 1944, Big Bend National Park became a reality.\"\nThat didn\u2019t seem like an explicit mention of permission being sought.\nIn the spirit of that excerpt, we looked briefly into how the pair of other major national parks came to be in Texas. A Texas State Historical Association web page says the Guadalupe Mountains park came about after a family in the 1930s offered to donate 300 acres of scenic McKittrick Canyon to the state of Texas. \"By the 1960s, land donations and sales to the National Park Service paved the way for the establishment of a national park\" in 1972, the web page says. And U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough initiated legislation to create the Padre Island National Seashore in 1957, a park service timeline indicates. Another agency web page says President Kennedy signed the park measure into law in 1962. Land was acquired from 1962 through 1969 and the park opened in 1970, the timeline says.\nLand commissioners divide\nBumfuzzled about the \"permission\" part of Hegar\u2019s tweet, we asked aides to the current land commissioner, George P. Bush, and a couple of his predecessors for guidance.\nAgency spokeswoman Brittany Eck said by email that if the federal government wanted to convert state-owned lands to a federal park, any sale would have to be approved by state lawmakers.\nBy phone, two former land commissioners, Republican Jerry Patterson and Democrat Garry Mauro, separately gave contradictory answers.\nPatterson said that given that the federal government doesn\u2019t already own a lot of Texas land convertible to parks, \"they'd have to get it. They\u2019d have to buy the land,\" he said, \"which implies\" getting permission.\nMauro said the federal government doesn\u2019t need permission from Texas to create a park. \"That\u2019s just a fact,\" Mauro said. \"The federal government can condemn what it wants to condemn.\"\nHistorian for park service\nWe also reached out to Robert Sutton, chief historian of the National Park Service, who said by phone it was news to him that the federal government had to ask permission to open a park in Texas. By email, Sutton subsequently said he checked the March 1845 congressional resolution setting terms for Texas joining the union, which says Texas is to keep its public lands but doesn\u2019t say anything about the federal government needing to ask permission to use Texas-owned land, Sutton noted, for any purpose. \"So, and I'm certainly not a constitutional lawyer, but I would say that the claim that the feds need to ask for permission is incorrect,\" Sutton wrote.\nWe shared Sutton\u2019s take with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for Hegar\u2019s state office. By email, Willis said it struck her as \"one historian\u2019s opinion.\"","cleaned_claim":"Texas still owns all of its public lands.

Brown\u2019s statement ignores this history, viewing smog\u2019s origin with only a California lens.\nBut looking deeper, a gradual shift in the term\u2019s meaning took place in the 1940s and 1950s as scientists, including Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit, studied the cause of Los Angeles\u2019 persistent and foul brown haze. In his statement, the governor references Haagen-Smit, who is credited as the first to prove L.A.\u2019s smog was caused by automobile exhaust, and who at least one current Caltech professor says is \"often described as inventing smog.\"\nThe governor\u2019s statement, while fuzzy at first glance, is partially accurate. But it leaves out important details and takes information out of context.\nWe rate the claim Half True.","full_article":"LISTEN TO THIS STORY:\nSunshine, Hollywood and freeway gridlock are all inextricably linked to Los Angeles, and so is smog.\nBut was the City of Angels the first to create the noxious, eye-stinging, smudgy haze? Weren\u2019t other industrial cities spewing thick black smoke and creating smog centuries ago?\nAs it turns out, it depends on what you consider \u2018smog.\u2019\nGov. Jerry Brown, a warrior in the state\u2019s air pollution battles, offered his California-centric version of smog\u2019s history during a speech in Los Angeles in October.\n\"Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was,\" the governor told an audience at Griffith Observatory, with downtown Los Angeles cloaked in a brown haze several miles away, as shown in photos of the event. \"The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog.\"\nThe governor made the claim during a ceremony marking the signing of California\u2019s landmark climate change bill, SB 350. It requires the state to get 50 percent of its electricity from air-friendly, renewable energy sources by 2030.\nWe decided to fact-check Brown\u2019s \"smog was invented in Los Angeles\" statement, to cut through what seemed like a dubious claim.\nSmog checking\nFirst, it\u2019s clear L.A. has no ownership over the term smog. Brown sounds like he was\u00a0having some fun with the \"invented in Los Angeles\" portion, from listening to him speak. Still, he\u00a0was literally and blatantly wrong.\nNews articles from as early as 1905 credit London doctor Harold Des Veaux with coining the word smog to describe natural fog contaminated by smoke, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.\nGreat Britain\u2019s affliction with foul air is referenced in Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth, written in 1606. But its soot-choked skies date as far back as the 12th century, when wood became scarce and residents turned to burning coal to keep warm, according to a history of the country\u2019s air pollution by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\nIt\u2019s clear that other urban centers fought the effects of smog long before anyone imagined the metropolis we call Los Angeles.\nSo, what kind of smoke was the governor blowing?\n\"Jerry Brown -- brilliant as he is -- is confusing some facts,\" said Chip Jacobs, author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles. \"We didn\u2019t invent smog. Smog has been known to arise in many parts of the world well before he was born.\"\nWe were headed for a False or Pants On Fire!\nThen, Jacobs added this comment: \"Brown did have something right in his jumbled pronouncement -- the Caltech professor.\"\nWas there some truth behind the governor\u2019s inartful statement? To get a better picture, we contacted the California Institute of Technology, based in Pasadena.\nSchool officials confirmed that Brown was referring to a 1940s-era Caltech professor named Arie Haagen-Smit.\nHaagen-Smit was the first to prove that automobile exhaust, when exposed to sunlight, creates what\u2019s referred to as photochemical smog, or modern-day smog. It\u2019s the same hazy brown gunk that\u2019s polluted Los Angeles\u2019 air for more than half a century. And it is different from the thick, black coal-driven smoke of London\u2019s industrial era.\n\"Professor Haagen-Smit did not invent (photochemical) smog, but he discovered the mechanism behind it. This has often been described as inventing smog,\" wrote Professor Richard Flagan, who teaches chemical engineering at Caltech, in an email.\nAnother expert on air quality in Los Angeles said the governor\u2019s claim is less murky than it appears.\n\"The term smog was used earlier, but it meant something totally different. The definition totally morphed,\" said Sarah Elkind, a history professor at San Diego State University.\n\"Los Angeles was the first city to deal with photo-chemical smog, which is part of the reason why I would judge Gov. Brown\u2019s statement as mostly correct,\" added Elkind, author of the book How Local Politics Shape Federal Policy: Business, Power, and the Environment in Twentieth Century Los Angeles.\nA spokesman for the governor said in an email that Haagen-Smit \"was the first one who coined the term for the modern air pollution produced by motor vehicles that we think of today.\" He also acknowledged that the term smog had been used to describe other types of pollution long before the 1940s.","cleaned_claim":"Smog was invented in Los Angeles.

Being allowed to buy health insurance isn\u2019t the same as getting welfare.\nThe group also recommended easing federal benefits restrictions on immigrants \u2014 but for those lawfully present in the United States. The recommendations do not deny benefits to U.S. citizens or give immigrants illegally in the country an upper hand.\nTrump\u2019s claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.","full_article":"In a speech berating Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, President Donald Trump claimed that Biden favored immigrants illegally in the country over U.S. citizens.\nSpeaking from the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said he\u2019d asked his people to draw up key elements of recommendations given to Biden by a task force composed of appointees of Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Trump said he couldn\u2019t believe what he read about immigrants and government benefits.\n\"Sign new immigrants up for welfare immediately. This is Joe Biden,\" Trump said July 14, reading from a document.\n\"So they walk off, and they come in, and they put a foot into our land, and we sign up new immigrants up for welfare,\" Trump continued. \"We sign them up immediately. They get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. Think of that: sign up \u2014 it's hard to believe I'm even reading that \u2014 new immigrants for welfare immediately.\"\nPolitiFact decided to review the task force recommendations and compare it against Trump\u2019s words. Our verdict: Trump offered a highly misleading interpretation.\nThe task force recommended undoing many of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, but not an immediate enrollment of immigrants for welfare. Welfare is a term that describes federal programs providing food, health care, housing and financial assistance to low-income families. Much less, it did not say that immigrants illegally in the country should have more benefits than U.S. citizens.\nNeither the White House nor Trump\u2019s re-election campaign provided evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim.\nRELATED: No, Joe Biden will not \u2018abolish\u2019 police or prisons, as Donald Trump said\nTask force recommendations\nThe recommendations most related to what Trump talked about focus on health care and a new \"public charge\" rule imposed by the Trump administration. But they don\u2019t seek what Trump said.\nAccess to health care during pandemic: The task force said that during any pandemic or public health crisis like COVID-19, health coverage should be available to everyone, regardless of immigration status, for testing, treatment and other medical services.\nAffordable Care Act extension: The task force recommended extending Affordable Care Act coverage to immigrants illegally in the country who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and allowing additional immigrants illegally in the country to also buy health insurance, unsubsidized.\nImmigrants illegally in the country currently are not eligible to buy health insurance offered through the Health Insurance Marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act. However, they may be eligible for Emergency Medicaid to cover emergency medical needs.\nSo the task force recommends allowing immigrants here illegally to get access to health care, including Affordable Care Act coverage. But being able to buy health insurance doesn\u2019t amount to getting welfare.\nOther health-related policies apply to immigrants who are lawfully in the United States. Trump in his speech at times said \"new immigrants\" \u2014 but the context shows that his focus was immigrants who come illegally, not those arriving legally.\nRescind public charge rules: The task force recommended rescinding new Trump regulations that allow immigration officials to deny immigrants visas if they are deemed \"more likely than not\" to use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers. Immigrants who are in the United States legally on temporary visas and have relied on such benefits could have more difficulty getting approved for lawful permanent residence.\nEnd five-year waiting period: Federal law says immigrants are not eligible for federal \"means-tested\" public benefits for five years starting on the date of their arrival as a \"qualified alien\" (such as lawful permanent resident). The task force said Biden should work with Congress to lift that five-year waiting period for low-income lawfully present immigrants, so they are eligible for Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\nThe proposed changes for the five-year waiting period and the public charge rule do not apply to immigrants illegally in the country, said Rebecca Sharpless, a professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law.\nMost federal assistance programs require that participants be U.S. citizens or eligible non-U.S. citizens. The recommendations presented to Biden do not restrict or prevent U.S. citizens from being eligible for the programs, despite Trump\u2019s claim that immigrants illegally in the country would be getting an advantage.","cleaned_claim":"Under Joe Biden\u2019s policy, immigrants in the country illegally get welfare benefits.

Earlier, he said something similar to CBS News and in a tweet.\nA reader asked us to check whether this was true, so we took a closer look.\nWhen we checked with Yang\u2019s campaign, they pointed to a survey by the Economist and YouGov conducted from July 21-23. The survey asked voters whether they planned to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus; if they said yes, they were asked who they would vote for.\nOut of 1,500 total adult respondents, 460 said they were planning to vote in a Democratic primary or caucus. Separately, poll respondents had been asked who they voted for in 2016, Trump or Hillary Clinton. Of those 460, 41 said they had voted for Trump in 2016.\nOf those 41 voters, 10% said they would support Yang, ranking him second to Bernie Sanders at 14%. Other candidates close to double digits were Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Julian Castro at 8%, while 12% said they weren\u2019t sure.\nThis tracks with what Yang said. But coming from the guy who says he wants to \"Make America Think Harder,\" Yang needs a course in how polling works.\nEconomist\/YouGov polls since July\nThe Economist\/YouGov poll has asked the same question every week since the July 21-23 survey Yang cited. The later polls squash any notion that Yang has high support among Trump voters.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of every Economist-YouGov poll with enough responses since late July, showing Yang\u2019s percentage among past Trump voters compared to other top finishers. We located these in the fivethirtyeight.com polling archive.\nOf the 11 subsequent polls, Yang only matched or exceeded 10% twice. More often, Yang\u2019s share of the Trump vote was much lower than that. In the most recent poll, Yang\u2019s share of the Trump voter support was zero.\nIn fact, the July poll Yang cites is the only time Yang finished in the top two among Democrats.\nAnd while Yang says he was only one of two candidates to surpass 10%, if you look across all of the polls, eight candidates actually achieved that \u2014 Yang, Biden, Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Marianne Williamson, Michael Bennet and Steve Bullock.\nThe full breakdown of the polls is attached at the bottom of this fact-check.\nThe statistic means little anyway\nIgnoring all of the above (even though you shouldn\u2019t), polling experts say the figure Yang cites is meaningless, because of the small sample of participants surveyed.\nIn most of the Economist\/YouGov polls, roughly 30-40 people said they voted for Trump in 2016 but would be voting in a Democratic primary or caucus in 2020. Ten percent of that (which is near Yang\u2019s high water mark) would represent three to four people.\nSteve Smith, a Washington University political scientist who runs his own online panel survey, said that corresponds to a standard margin of error of about plus or minus 15 percentage points. That renders the question useless to anyone who cares about statistics, polling or math.\nWhen we checked with Joe Williams, the YouGov director of polling, he said he agreed with our overall analysis of Yang\u2019s assertion.\nWhen we contacted the Yang campaign, they said they stood by their talking point.","cleaned_claim":"I'm one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general election.","ambiguity_score":0.1594345421,"paraphrases":[["I am one of the only two candidates in the field who 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general election.",0.0146373045],["I'm one of only two candidates that a significant portion of Donald Trump's supporters say they would vote for in the general election.",0.0514655001],["I am one of the two candidates that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters would support in the general election.",0.0316088572],["I'm one of the only two candidates in the field that a significant portion of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general election.",0.0858756527],["I'm one of the only two candidates in the field that a significant number of Donald Trump voters say they would support in the general election.",0.1594345421]]}

Its rules for allowing concealed carry are more relaxed than in California or New York -- states that allow local jurisdictions to regulate concealed carry within their boundaries.\nNor are penalties for violating gun laws in Illinois the toughest in the United States. Mandatory minimum sentences make New York state\u2019s laws tougher than those in Illinois.\nTrump\u2019s statement contains an element of truth -- Chicago leads the nation for number of gun-related crimes this year -- but it ignores the fact that a U.S. Supreme Court decision and a change in state law brought Chicago in line with other cities on handgun rules.\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.","full_article":"When professing his belief in protecting the Second Amendment, Donald Trump often has invoked Chicago as a place that proves gun regulation does not equate with reduced gun crime.\u00a0He\u2019s been making this claim longer than he\u2019s been a candidate for president:\nIn his final debate with Hillary Clinton on Oct. 19, Trump repeated this statement: \"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.\"\nFor Chicago, 2016 has been a year of record gun violence. The pre-Halloween weekend was the deadliest of the year, with 17 people killed. \"There have been at least 638 homicides so far this year, 217 more than this time last year, the data show. At least 3,662 people have been shot in the city, 1,106 more than during the same period last year,\" the Chicago Tribune reported on Oct. 31.\nAs of Aug. 30, Chicago had more homicides and shootings than New York and Los Angeles combined.\nBut does Chicago really have what Trump calls \"the toughest gun laws in the United States?\" The Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for documentation. So to find out, we\u2019ll look at \"gun laws\" from two angles, possession and sentencing of gun offenders.\nPossession\nFor two years, Chicago did have the toughest gun possession law in the country. In 1982, the city banned possession of handguns by civilians, joining Washington, D.C., in prohibiting handgun possession. But the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2008 District of Columbia vs. Heller decision ruled the D.C. law unconstitutional, making Chicago the lone holdout among major cities for handgun prohibition. (A handful of Chicago suburbs had enacted bans along with Chicago\u2019s.)\nBut the Heller decision paved the way for the 2010 McDonald vs. City of Chicago decision that extended the Heller decision -- which had overturned a law specific to the District of Columbia -- to states.\nThat meant Chicago no longer could ban handgun possession. Chicagoans, however, still faced stricter gun laws than residents of other major cities because Illinois was alone among states in not allowing concealed carry of firearms.\nIllinois became the last state in the nation to adopt concealed carry in July 2013, eight months after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state\u2019s ban on concealed carry was unconstitutional.\nWith that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities.\nIllinois\u2019 gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its \"Smart Gun Laws\" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners\u2019 ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases.\nBut it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are.\nViolations\nAnother way to interpret Trump\u2019s statement is that Chicago\u2019s gun laws are strict because they impose strict penalties on those who violate them.\nBut here, too, Illinois falls short -- much to the chagrin of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\nEmanuel has argued for years that sentencing guidelines for gun offenders in Illinois are too lenient. The Chicago street gang members who have propelled the city to the top of the gun violence list, Emanuel has said, face harsher punishment from their gang leaders for losing a gun than for getting arrested with one.\n\"Let me remind you what one admitted gangbanger said in 2012 to a reporter. This is what the gangbanger said: that his gun possession arrest was a joke. Gangbangers know how to manipulate the criminal justice system, and they know its weaknesses first-hand,\" Emanuel said in a major speech Sept. 22 to address public safety in the city amid public furor over the Laquan McDonald shooting. \"Our criminal justice system is fractured, and it is undermining Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods.\"\nA Chicago Sun-Times analysis a year earlier had found that gun sentences for Chicago offenders were more lenient than elsewhere:\nIn Chicago, felons illegally possessing a gun typically get four years, the Sun-Times found \u2014 toward the low end of the state sentencing guidelines.\nAnd those are the sentences judges hand out, not the actual prison time.\nMost people convicted of these gun crimes serve less than half of their prison terms because of \"good time\" that inmates can get credit for under state law, in addition to credit for time held in the Cook County Jail while awaiting trial.\nNew York, by comparison, has a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 3 1\/2 years for simple gun possession.\nIn 2013, Emanuel pushed unsuccessfully for the Illinois General Assembly to impose mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes. The effort was blocked by lawmakers concerned that it would lead to increased incarceration of young blacks and Latinos.","cleaned_claim":"In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.","ambiguity_score":0.1093730181,"paraphrases":[["Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, but it also has more gun violence than any other city.",0.0171340257],["Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the United States, and yet it has more gun violence than any other city.",0.0274045486],["Despite having some of the strictest gun laws in the country, Chicago continues to suffer from high levels of gun violence.",0.0296551939],["In Chicago, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, there is more gun violence than in any other city.",0.1093730181],["Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the US, but it also has more gun violence than any other city.",0.0165631864]]}

However, only about a tenth of the 300,000 people in the ad would be directly affected by the laws in question.\nWe rate this statement Half True.","full_article":"The midterm elections are dredging up talk of Obamacare once more, but the Democrats are not calling it by its name.\nHeidi Heitkamp, a vulnerable Democrat from North Dakota running for Senate re-election, attacked her Republican challenger in a digital ad campaign for his votes to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nHer challenger, Kevin Cramer, has been a representative for North Dakota in the House since 2013.\n\"This is Denise,\" Heitkamp says in the 30-second spot released on Aug. 16. \"She lives in Kildeer. Like 300,000 North Dakotans, Denise has a pre-existing condition. That used to mean no health insurance. For me it\u2019s breast cancer, for Denise it\u2019s heart disease.\"\n\"She has something she\u2019d like to say to Kevin Cramer. \u2018Mr Cramer, I don\u2019t know why you voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. But I know Heidi would never do that.\u2019 \"\nHeitkamp is talking about several votes Cramer cast in 2013 and again in 2016 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s take a look at what they did.\nKey takeaways\n\u2022 300,000 includes everyone with some sort of pre-existing condition. The people whose health plans might be at risk is a fraction of that.\n\u2022 Cramer cast votes\u00a0to both repeal Obamacare and replace it with skimpier plans.\n\u2022 While these replacements kept protections for pre-existing conditions in place, they\u00a0stripped some of the safeguards that make those plans affordable today.\nCramer and\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\nThe Affordable Care Act made sure that people without health insurance got coverage. The problematic sector was the individual, or non-group, market: those not covered by their employer or by the government. They form the smallest part of the market.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, people in that market could get turned down for having a pre-existing condition (anything from hay fever to cancer); could get charged more for it; or could be offered a health plan that excluded its coverage. Now, all of those things are illegal.\nThe Heitkamp campaign said there are 300,000 individuals with pre-existing conditions in North Dakota, rounding the 275,556 calculated by Health and Human Services in 2009 and 316,000 calculated by the Center for American Progress.\nThose numbers are credible, but the majority of those individuals are covered by group plans. So voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not a vote to strip coverage from all 300,000. Instead, it\u00a0would jeopardize coverage for the non-group market, which covered 9 percent of North Dakotans in 2016. The ad does not make clear whether Denise is in the group or individual market.\nHeitkamp sent us Cramer's votes to strip funding for the Affordable Care Act and one vote to repeal it. Cramer\u2019s campaign told us he has always supported coverage of pre-existing conditions, pointing to the American Health Care Act and Graham-Cassidy.\nWhatever Cramer\u2019s wish is, his votes jeopardize coverage as it stands for pre-existing conditions in the individual market, according to Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care organization.\nBy the letter of the law the bills protect pre-existing conditions. But they take away the mandate that everyone be insured and the subsidies that make that affordable. In practice, plans for individuals in the nongroup market would become exorbitantly priced, if available at all.","cleaned_claim":"Kevin Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.","ambiguity_score":0.0355540998,"paraphrases":[["Kevin Cramer voted to allow insurance companies to refuse coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.",0.0317220613],["Kevin Cramer voted to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.",0.0355540998]]}

We rate it Mostly False.\nPolitiFact Pennsylvania reporter Jessica Calafeti contributed to this article.","full_article":"Former Vice President Joe Biden has rejected the notion of \"defunding the police,\" but that hasn\u2019t stopped his critics from trying to pin the slogan on him.\nA recent Trump campaign ad misrepresented Biden\u2019s stated position. And now a chorus of conservative voices is seizing on snippets of an interview as evidence that the former vice president does support defunding the police after all.\nVice President Mike Pence on July 9 visited the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 in Northeast Philadelphia for a Back the Blue rally with an audience of 300 police officers and their supporters. Pence recognized officers killed or injured in the line of duty and denounced calls to defund police departments across the country.\n\"And I heard that, just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police in his words \u2018become the enemy\u2019 and he said that he would \u2018absolutely cut funding for law enforcement,\u2019\" Pence said.\nBut Biden\u2019s actual comments didn\u2019t go as far as Pence claimed.\nBiden said in the interview that he is open to shifting some federal police funds to other programs. Otherwise, he has proposed increasing federal funding for community policing, and has consistently called for linking federal law-enforcement funding to policing reforms.\nAnd while Biden did use the word \"enemy\" in his comments, Pence distorted what Biden actually said.\nWhat Biden has said\nTrump has falsely claimed that Biden wants to \"defund the police.\" That term isn\u2019t a precise concept. While some protesters seeking police reform want to eliminate police departments entirely, most public officials who have used the phrase want to revisit the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding toward social services.\nBiden has repeatedly stated his opposition to defunding the police.\n\"I don't support defunding the police,\" Biden told CBS News in a clip aired June 8. \"I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness \u2014 and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.\"\nHe repeated that stance in a June 10 op-ed in USA Today.\n\"While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people\u2019s rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police,\" Biden wrote. \"The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms.\"\nBiden has actually taken some heat from activists for his relatively moderate position on the issue. In June, more than 50 liberal groups signed a letter to Biden calling on him to support defunding police and criticizing his promise to add $300 million for community policing programs.\nNew interview\nPence\u2019s statement followed a video interview Biden did with liberal activist Ady Barkan that posted July 8.\nThe Biden campaign told us that the video was edited before being shared online.\nBarkan spent most of the 27-minute remote interview asking about health care. But about 20 minutes in, the discussion turned to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both of whom were killed in encounters with police.\nAlluding to demands made by Black Lives Matter, Barkan said deadly police encounters with citizens could be reduced if some police funding were redirected to social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing.\n\"Are you open to that kind of reform?\" he asked.\nBiden replied: \"Yes. I proposed that kind of reform.\"\nBiden said he has called for more mental health funding, as well as police reforms such as transparency in officer misconduct records. He did not speak directly about reducing police funding.\nBiden then talked about police using military equipment in their communities, which is where the \"enemy\" comment came up:\n\"Surplus military equipment for law enforcement \u2014 they don't need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it's like the military invading. They don't know anybody; they become the enemy, they\u2019re supposed to be protecting these people.\"\nBarkan then interjected, asking: \"But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?\"\nBiden replied: \"Yes. Absolutely.\"\nThe Biden campaign gave PolitiFact an audio recording of that portion of the interview. After, \"Yes. Absolutely,\" according to the recording, Biden said, \"And by the way, not just redirect, condition them.\" He offered holding up federal law enforcement grants if agencies used no-knock warrants or did not eliminate choke holds.\nSo, Biden said he \"absolutely\" would shift some funds from police to other services, but he has also proposed adding funding for community policing.","cleaned_claim":"And I heard that just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police in his words \u2018become the enemy\u2019 and he said that he would \u2018absolutely cut funding for law enforcement.\u2019","ambiguity_score":0.1073745564,"paraphrases":[["Yesterday, Joe Biden said that police who are well-armed become the enemy, and that he would cut funding for law enforcement.",0.1073745564],["I heard that Joe Biden said that well-armed police become the enemy and that he would cut funding for law enforcement.",0.00768696],["I heard that Joe Biden said that police who are armed become the enemy, and that he would cut funding for law enforcement.",0.011927817],["Yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police become the enemy, and that he would cut funding for law enforcement.",0.0982736796]]}

Must have final total on November 3rd,\" Trump tweeted on Oct. 26\nThe following day, Trump added in remarks to reporters, \"It would be very, very proper and very nice if a winner were declared on Nov. 3, instead of counting ballots for two weeks, which is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws.\"\nHowever, the president was wrong. When the media \"calls\" a presidential race \u2014 which may or may not happen on Election Night \u2014 it is because they feel that projections from the current results are strong enough to announce one candidate over the other. It\u2019s not an official result.\n\"There are no official results on Election Night \u2014 there never have been,\" said Edward B. Foley, an Ohio State University constitutional law professor who specializes in elections. \"Election Night tallies are always just preliminary, pending certification of the canvass of returns under state law, which takes time. Every state has a law on this point.\"\nEspecially in this year\u2019s election, when many voters are sending in their ballots or voting early in person rather than voting on Election Day due to the coronavirus pandemic, experts say it will take a decisive victory by one candidate or the other to be able to declare a winner on Election Night or early the following morning. (Trump\u2019s tweet was later flagged by Twitter as potentially harming the integrity of the election.).\nHere are some of the specific reasons why Trump is off-base.\nAbsentee ballots\nAccording to the National Conference on State Legislatures, 19 states have laws allowing ballots to be counted if they arrive after Election Day, but are postmarked on Election Day (or, in some states, the day before Election Day). This number could vary this year due to pending litigation.\nIn many cases, such postmark rules for absentee ballots have been around \"for years,\" said Matthew Weil, director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nIn close races, even a modest number of late-arriving ballots could prove decisive.\nOverseas military ballots\nMany states allow service members stationed overseas a grace period for ballots they mail back to the mainland. For instance, states like Texas and West Virginia will require overseas military ballots to be received by Nov. 9, while others require a postmark, but not receipt, by Nov. 3, such as Georgia and Nevada.\nProvisional ballots\nProvisional ballots are those that are cast when a voter\u2019s eligibility is in question. If election officials resolve those questions, the ballot will be counted, but the checking and counting process takes time.\nThe rules for provisional ballots were streamlined by the Help America Vote Act, a federal law passed in 2002. \"Provisional ballots by their very nature cannot be counted on Election Day or Election Night and must be verified subsequently as part of the canvassing of returns,\" Foley said.\nState certification of results\nUnder federal law, states have until Dec. 8, or six days before the presidential electors vote, to finalize their ballot count.\nThis deadline acknowledges, as a matter of federal law, that states are not obligated to have a final official result on Election Night.\nEven if a projected winner were to be announced by television networks and other media companies on Election Night, nothing would be official until the presidential electors cast their ballots on Dec. 14, and Congress officially counts the electoral votes on Jan. 6.\nAs a practical matter, Weil said, \"the vast majority of ballots will be counted within two or three days of Election Day, even in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin that cannot start counting absentee ballots until the day before Election Day or on Election Day itself.\"\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.","cleaned_claim":"Counting ballots for weeks after Election Day is totally inappropriate, and I don't believe that's by our laws.","ambiguity_score":0.0334383212,"paraphrases":[["It is inappropriate to count ballots for weeks after Election Day, and I don't believe that is allowed by our laws.",0.0219291523],["I don't think it's right to keep counting ballots long after Election Day, and I don't think that's what our laws allow.",0.0255146697],["It is inappropriate to count ballots for weeks after Election Day, and I do not believe that this is allowed by our laws.",0.0223996397],["I believe that it is inappropriate to continue counting ballots long after Election Day, as this is not in line with our laws.",0.0334383212]]}

But Cooper\u2019s executive order didn\u2019t offer a reason why liquor stores or any other businesses are considered essential.\nKelly Haight Connor, spokeswoman for North Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services, told PolitiFact in an email that the reasoning was simple.\n\"People need to stay home as much as possible. And while restaurants, bars and other areas of communal gathering must be closed, people should be able to buy items used in their day to day lives,\" she said.\nPolitiFact could find no proof that Cooper\u2019s decision to designate liquor stores as essential businesses was made to accommodate people who might be dependent on alcohol.\nFurther, if liquor stores were hypothetically asked to close, North Carolinians could still access alcohol in the form of wine and beer at grocery stores.\nWhen we reached out to Jackson about this claim, his office noted that individual ABC boards across the state have the flexibility to decide whether or not they want to remain open.\nJeff Strickland, a spokesman for the ABC Commission, confirmed each of the state\u2019s 170 boards does, indeed, have that freedom. \"If a board wants to close down, they have that authority,\" Strickland said.\nThe commission doesn\u2019t have an official stance on why its stores should or shouldn\u2019t remain open, he added.\nWhat some ABC owners say\nTo that end, Jackson\u2019s office pointed out that some ABC store operators have cited alcohol dependency as a reason for staying open.\nJackson\u2019s office emailed us an article by WLOS in Asheville, where local ABC manager Jason Thacker told WLOS that he\u2019s heard concerns about overwhelming hospitals.\n\"Studies show that abruptly limiting access to alcohol could lead to an increase in withdrawal for people with severe alcohol use disorder and add to the burden of the health care system, which is the last thing that needs to happen right now,\" Thacker told WLOS.\nJackson\u2019s office also provided links to stories about why liquor stores are being kept open in other states such as Connecticut, New Jersey and Texas. In Connecticut, for example, Gov. Ned Lamont said there\u2019s a medical reason behind the exemption for liquor stores.\n\"I think the thought process by the (Connecticut) governor is that if we do close the liquor stores this could create an unnecessary problem and really cut off a needed resource,\" Dr. Andrew Lim, the medical director of Bristol Hospital\u2019s Emergency Department, told NBC News in Connecticut.\nHowever, addiction specialists aren\u2019t unified in their belief that liquor store access will prevent emergency room admissions.\nJohn Watkins, who owns Johnston Counseling Services, told WRAL that people who are physically dependent on alcohol could suffer withdrawal symptoms in less than a day if they can\u2019t access it.\nBut Ward Blanchard, president of The Blanchard Institute addiction recovery center in Charlotte, told Spectrum News that leaving ABC stores open could also lead to ER admissions. He said some who are dependent on alcohol could, if left alone with high volumes of it, go overboard.\n\"When you are in a situation where people are isolated and there is already stress and anxiety, and then you throw liquor on top of that, I think that would overthrow a healthcare system more so than closing it would,\" Blanchard said.","cleaned_claim":"NC liquor stores were deemed essential because we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms.","ambiguity_score":0.0371603183,"paraphrases":[["The reason that North Carolina liquor stores were deemed essential is because there are a lot of people in the state who are dependent on alcohol, and if they suddenly lost access to it, they would experience withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms.",0.0367691964],["The North Carolina liquor stores were deemed essential because there are many people who are addicted to alcohol and if they suddenly lost access to it, they would go into withdrawal and overwhelm the emergency rooms.",0.0371603183],["NC liquor stores were deemed essential because we have a lot of people who are chemically dependent on alcohol and if we suddenly cut off their access, they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms.",0.0117070088],["NC liquor stores were allowed to stay open because there are many people who are chemically dependent on alcohol, and if they suddenly lost access to it, they would go into withdrawal and flood the emergency rooms.",0.0271635912],["NC liquor stores are considered essential because many people are dependent on alcohol and would experience withdrawal if access was suddenly cut off.

We did it without chaos and disorder. And yes, we did it with Democratic mayors in most of the major cities in this country.

Do you feel really safer under Donald Trump?\"\nPolitiFact decided to fact-check Biden\u2019s \"simple facts.\" We found that his claim is partly accurate and needs context.\n\u2018Violent crime fell 15%\u2019\nBiden\u2019s claim of a 15% decrease is supported by the change in the rate of violent crime; the decline in the total number of crimes was less than 15%.\nBiden\u2019s campaign cited as evidence a 2017 story from FactCheck.org, which summarized key statistics related to President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years in office.\nBased on data collected by the FBI, the fact-checking organization found that the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people in Obama\u2019s last full year in office, 2016, was nearly 16% lower than the rate in 2008, the year before Obama took office. Likewise, the total number of violent crimes in 2016 was about 10% lower than the total number in 2008.\n\u2018Murder rate now is up 26% across the nation\u2019\nIn discussing what Biden says has happened to the murder rate under Trump, Biden\u2019s campaign cited an analysis by crime analyst Jeff Asher that pointed out a 26% increase in the number of murders.\nThe analysis was not adjusted for population and did not specify the rate change. (For instance, the FBI calculates the murder rate as being per 100,000 people.) But Asher and two other criminologists not involved in the analysis told PolitiFact that since the population changes very little from one year to the other, the murder rate increase would also be around 26%.\nAsher analyzed violent crime data in 25 U.S. cities. He looked at the number of murders in 2019 from January through at least July and compared it with the number of murders in 2020 from January through at least July. (He used comparable August data for some cities.)\nWhile Asher\u2019s analysis focused on select cities, not nationwide data, he said it can be useful for estimating the national trend. Usually, the FBI in late September releases a final report on nationwide crime statistics from the previous year.\nWhat Biden\u2019s remarks left out\nBiden touted a decrease in violent crime during his vice presidency and denounced a 2020 spike in murders under Trump. But he highlighted different metrics and different time sets for each administration. By doing so, Biden presented an incomplete and skewed picture of the crime data.\nA more accurate examination of crime would focus on the same set of data and comparable time periods, said Jay Corzine, a criminologist at the University of Central Florida.\nThe FBI figures on violent crime include the offenses of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Biden focused on this broader number for the claim about his vice presidency, and flagged only murder data for the claim on Trump\u2019s record.\n\n\nBiden focused on numbers before and at the end of his 8-year tenure, 2008 and 2016. For Trump, he focused on about seven months for 2019 and 2020.\nFor the claim about his own record, Biden did not mention the murder rate. The murder rate in 2008 was the same as it was in 2016, 5.4 murders per 100,000 people.\nBoth the violent crime and murder rates went down in 2017 and in 2018, Trump\u2019s first two years in office. (The FBI has not released final data for 2019.) Asher said that while murders so far were up in 2020 compared with 2019, \"violent crime is roughly even.\"\nHow much does a president or vice president impact crime statistics?\nMost of the influence any presidential administration has on crime statistics is indirect, based on their support for anti-crime measures and funding assistance, criminologists told PolitiFact.\n\"Most crime is local and what really impacts crime rates are local policing, state laws \u2014 what states and cities do,\" said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University.\nHomicide numbers are also volatile, there\u2019s wide fluctuation from year to year that has nothing to do with laws or policies, Fox said. Built into the homicide figures are a lot of chance factors, such as where a bullet hits and whether the person is taken to a hospital on time, he said.\nMurders in some cities have spiked this year amid the coronavirus pandemic, yet violent crime across the board (including property crime) hasn\u2019t similarly increased, Corzine noted.\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly why murders are up in some places. However, \"bad things can happen in the course of idle time,\" Fox said, noting that the pandemic caused many people to be out of work and out of school with no summer activities.","cleaned_claim":"When I was vice president, violent crime fell 15% in this country. ...

Cuomo asked Fauci to explain why people would still need to wear masks after they were vaccinated against COVID-19. The Instagram post excerpts a clip from the conversation:\n\"Just because you\u2019re protected,\" Fauci is seen saying in the post, \"so-called protected by the vaccine, you still need to remember that you could be prevented from getting clinical disease and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx, because you can get infected. We\u2019re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine prevents you against getting infected.\"\nAt that point in the Instagram video, a voice cuts in to emphasize what it appears Fauci is saying:\nVoiceover:\u00a0\"We\u2019re not sure at this point that the vaccine prevents you against getting infected.\"\nFauci: \"We know for sure it\u2019s very, very good, 94, 95%, in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease.\"\nVoiceover: \"Clinically recognizable disease?

The post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nFauci was being very scientifically precise with his words, but there was nothing nefarious behind his statement.\n(Screenshot from Instagram)\nAccording to CNN\u2019s transcript, Fauci\u2019s full response to Cuomo\u2019s question about the continued need to wear masks was:\n\"Well, the answer is unless you get the overwhelming majority of the country vaccinated, and protected, and get that umbrella of what we call herd immunity, there's still a lot of virus out there.\n\"So just because you're protected, so-called protected, by the vaccine, you should need to remember that you could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected.\n\"We're not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected. We know for sure it's very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease, and almost 100% in protecting you for severe disease.\n\"But until you have virus that is so low in society, we, as a nation, need to continue, to wear the mask, to keep the physical distance, to avoid crowds. We're not through with this just because we're starting a vaccine program.\n\"Even though you, as an individual, might have gotten vaccinated, it is not over by any means. We still have a long way to go, and we've got to get as many people as possible vaccinated, of all groups.\"\nWhen Fauci said this in December, research on the COVID-19 vaccines showed that the vaccines prevent people from developing the disease COVID-19. But research was \u2014 and is \u2014 still underway to determine whether or not the vaccines stop people from being infected with the virus and transmitting it to others.\nThe confusion about Fauci\u2019s statements stems from the distinction between the disease caused by the virus and the virus itself.\nCOVID-19 is the World Health Organization\u2019s official name for the coronavirus disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, is the WHO\u2019s official name for the virus that causes COVID-19. Both names have been used when discussing the pandemic since they were announced in February 2020.\nHelp shape our fact-checking! Take PolitiFact\u2019s reader survey now >>\nIn recent months, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency use authorization for three vaccines that, in the FDA\u2019s own words, are \"for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\"\nFirst on Dec. 11, just days after this Fauci interview, the FDA cleared the Pfizer vaccine for distribution and use in the U.S. On Dec. 18, the FDA cleared the Moderna vaccine for distribution and use. Finally, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine became the third vaccine cleared for distribution and use in the U.S. on Feb. 27.\nThe CDC reports that after two doses, the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective \"in preventing COVID-19\" and the Moderna vaccine is 94.1% effective.\nThe one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was tested \"during a more complicated phase of the pandemic\" when variants had emerged, is also effective at preventing COVID-19, according to the Washington Post.\n\"It was more than 80% effective at preventing severe illness, including in areas of the world where concerning variants are circulating, but only 66% protective overall when moderate cases were included,\" the story said.\nIt is important to note, however, that further research is needed to determine if any of the vaccines in use prevent people from being infected with the virus, therefore slowing transmission.\nMany vaccines do not prevent against infection or transmission, but they do keep people from getting seriously ill and having to go to the hospital.\n\"In general, most vaccines do not completely prevent infection but do prevent the infection from spreading within the body and from causing disease,\" reads a Johns Hopkins FAQ about vaccines. \"Many vaccines can also prevent transmission, potentially leading to herd protection whereby unvaccinated people are protected from infection by the vaccinated people around them because they have less chance of exposure to the virus.\"\nSome preliminary research indicates the COVID-19 vaccines have some ability to reduce infection and transmission, but real world research into this complex topic is still underway.\n\"We are still learning whether or not the current Covid-19 vaccines prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2,\" the Johns Hopkins FAQ continues. \"It is likely they reduce the risk of virus transmission but probably not completely in everyone.\"\nThis means vaccinated people might not develop the \"clinically recognizable\" COVID-19 disease Fauci was referring to, but they could become infected with the virus and spread it if they do not continue to wear masks and avoid crowds, for example.","cleaned_claim":"Video suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci said vaccines don\u2019t protect against COVID-19.","ambiguity_score":0.9035292864,"paraphrases":[["A video has surfaced that seems to show Dr. Anthony Fauci saying that vaccines don't protect against COVID-19.",0.8807780147],["In a video that has surfaced online, Dr. Anthony Fauci appears to suggest that vaccines may not be effective in protecting against COVID-19.",0.8351227045],["A video has surfaced which appears to show Dr. Anthony Fauci saying that vaccines do not protect against COVID-19.

Former ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson personally lobbied against the measure before it became law, and the company continued to oppose it as recently as March 2016. ExxonMobil preferred a different reporting regime, rather than no reporting at all, but its opposition was steadfast.\nWe rate the claim True.","full_article":"A resolution on President Donald Trump\u2019s desk would kill a regulation the oil lobby has opposed for six years. The rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil, gas and mining companies to report pretty much everything they pay to governments for the right to extract resources. The rule\u2019s goal was to prevent corruption in developing countries where top officials might feather their nests and leave their people destitute.\nHouse Republicans, joined by a handful of Democrats, voted to nullify the rule on Feb. 1, and two days later on a straight party-line vote, the Senate followed suit.\nDuring the debate on the Senate floor, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said the transparency under the regulation was an \"essential tool\" against fraud and abuse, but it had powerful enemies.\n\"Since the rule\u2019s creation, ExxonMobil, led by Mr. Tillerson -- now the secretary of state -- and Big Oil allies, such as the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Heritage Foundation, have fought to kill it,\" Brown said.\nWe decided to explore whether ExxonMobil fought to kill the rule.\nIt did, and Tillerson played a direct role.\nThe action began in 2008.\nThat year, then Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., spearheaded a report on corruption in developing nations rooted in their natural resources. In the most extreme cases, money from oil or other resources set off a scramble for personal wealth that left nations in Africa, South America and Asia less stable and deeper in poverty. Transparency, Lugar wrote, was crucial to beating the \"resource curse.\"\n\"When oil revenue in a producing country can be easily tracked, that nation\u2019s elite are more likely to use revenues for the vital needs of their citizens and less likely to squander newfound wealth for self-aggrandizing projects,\" he wrote.\nLugar wanted a law that would tell the SEC to craft a rule for companies to follow. He co-sponsored an amendment with Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., that became part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill in 2010. Under the measure, any oil, gas or mining company listed on the U.S. stock exchange had to report \"taxes, royalties, fees (including license fees), production entitlements, bonuses, and other material benefits,\" paid to any government. The reporting had to be done country by country and project by project.\nExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, opposed the proposal every step of the way.\nIn 2010, Jay Branegan worked for Lugar as a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now at the Lugar Center, a policy group in Washington, D.C., Branegan told us that in 2010, before Dodd-Frank passed, Tillerson himself came to Lugar\u2019s office to argue against the amendment.\n\"He listed a number of his and the industry\u2019s objections to the bill, including that it would harm Exxon\u2019s relations with Russia,\" Branegan said. \"He was the only CEO to come in to lobby personally.\"\nWe asked ExxonMobil spokesman William Holbrook for the company\u2019s take on the accuracy of Branegan\u2019s account. Holbrook said, \"The SEC rule has been a concern for the industry at large, not ExxonMobil exclusively.\"\nHolbrook argued that the rule put ExxonMobil at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies and that \"ExxonMobil is committed to being a good corporate citizen, and part of that commitment includes transparency in reporting payments to foreign governments.\"\n\"The SEC largely ignored industry\u2019s comments and recommendations in finalizing its rule,\" Holbrook said.\nExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute had several changes in mind but a key one had to do with the details the SEC reported to the public. Ideally, they wanted the SEC to lump all payments a government received together, rather than show what each company paid. They certainly didn\u2019t want to report for each project.\nExxonMobil voiced its objections in letters to the SEC on Jan. 31, 2011, March 15, 2011 \u00a0and Oct. 25, 2011.\nThe SEC actually went through two cycles in writing the rules. After the SEC came up with version one, a lawsuit sent the commission back to the drawing board. The second try wrapped up June 27, 2016. As recently as March 2016, ExxonMobil raised objections to the revised approach, saying the SEC plan would increase costs, harm shareholders and \"sow confusion.\"\nNot all major oil companies objected so vigorously to the rule.\nRoyal Dutch Shell wrote, \"While we believe the American Petroleum Institute proposal is superior to the Commission\u2019s re-proposal, we would support the Commission re-proposal with certain minor changes.\" BP took the same line.\nA key factor for Shell and BP was that all 28 European Union countries, plus Canada and Norway, had already adopted disclosure rules modeled on the original SEC version. The two companies wanted to be able to give the SEC the same reports they were filing in the EU. The SEC adopted that.\nJana Morgan, director of Publish What You Pay, an advocacy group that supports mandatory reporting, told us the nullification of the American rule would put the country in an odd position.\n\"Canada and countries in Europe adopted similar legislation to the United States because the United States passed it first,\" Morgan said. \"Assuming the regulation is pulled back, the United States will be out of sync with the global transparency standard.\"","cleaned_claim":"ExxonMobil fought to kill a rule requiring oil and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments.","ambiguity_score":0.0301596336,"paraphrases":[["ExxonMobil lobbied against a rule that would have required oil and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments.",0.0297088828],["ExxonMobil argued against a rule that would require oil and mining companies to reveal the payments they made to foreign governments.",0.0116167273],["ExxonMobil lobbied against a regulation that would have forced oil and mining companies to publicly disclose any payments made to foreign governments.",0.022631146],["ExxonMobil argued against a rule that would have required oil and mining companies to reveal payments made to foreign governments.",0.0122391656],["ExxonMobil lobbied against a regulation that would have required oil and mining companies to report any payments made to foreign governments.",0.0301596336]]}

Against the gains under Trump, the image had these grim numbers for Obama:\nJobs lost: 4 million\n\n\nUnemployment: Rose from 7.85 to 9.9%\n\n\nS&P (500): 1,115.1\n\n\nGDP Change: Down 2.8%\nMullin\u2019s office told us they got the numbers from a CNN Money article and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We checked the original sources \u2013 the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the S&P 500 index, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The numbers are right, and in fact the latest numbers for Trump would look even a little better.\nThe message, however, is thoroughly deceptive.\nThe CNN Money article Mullin's office cited points out the danger of judging any president based on his first year alone.\nIt quotes historian Douglas Brinkley saying, \"It's not after year one or two that people judge a president. That can affect midterm elections. But what presidents are remembered for are the numbers when they leave office.\"\nThe examples in the article make that quite clear.\nPresident Jimmy Carter\u2019s first year had 3.1 million more jobs, falling unemployment and a GDP of 4.6 percent. But by his last year, the country was in recession. Unemployment had\u00a0gone from a low of 5.6 percent\u00a0to a high of 7.5 percent. Annual GDP was a negative 0.2 percent.\nPresident Ronald Reagan\u2019s first year had anemic job growth of 130,000 and rising unemployment that reached 8.3 percent. But when he left, the country had gained nearly 16 million jobs, unemployment was down to 5.3 percent and GDP growth was 4.2 percent.\nPresident George H.W. Bush took over with an economic wind at his back, but a downturn hit and while the economy recovered, it wasn\u2019t enough to win him a second term. GDP growth stood at 3.7 percent when he came in and bottomed out at negative 0.1 percent. Unemployment started at 5.4 percent and climbed to 7.4 percent in his last year.\nPresident Bill Clinton had a moderately good first year, but closed out with impressive GDP growth of 4.7 percent, an unemployment rate of 4 percent and a net gain of \u00a0almost 23 million jobs.\nPresident George W. Bush had a poor first year and disastrous last one, as the country slipped into the Great Recession. GDP growth in 2001 was 1 percent. When Bush left, it was a negative 0.3 percent and unemployment had gone from 4.2 percent to 7.3 percent.\nWhen we apply the yardstick of where things stand from the beginning to the end of a president\u2019s tenure, Obama looks quite different from the picture Mullin paints.\nWhen Obama took office, GDP was falling at a rate of 2.8 percent. When he left, GDP was growing by 1.5 percent and it had reached 2.9 percent the year before. The country had 11.2 million more jobs. Unemployment had gone from a high of 10 percent during his first year to 4.7 percent when he left.\n\"As most nonpartisan economists recognize, you cannot blame a new president for the economic conditions that prevail when he or she takes the oath of office,\" economist Gary Burtless of Brookings told us. \"Those are the responsibility of the previous administration.

While helpful, that would still be only a small portion of the more than 700,000 daily tests being conducted, which some experts say falls short of what is needed.\nAdditionally, while vet labs are helping in some ways, Giroir provided little evidence to back up his assertion that \"lots\" of labs that lack CLIA certification are assisting in surveillance efforts.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.","full_article":"In a heated exchange late last month on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper pressed Adm. Brett Giroir, the Health and Human Services assistant secretary who oversees COVID testing efforts for the Trump administration, on why the government isn\u2019t requiring commercial labs to increase testing capacity in order to speed turnaround time.\nGiroir\u2019s response described a series of steps \u2014 some unusual \u2014 being taken by the federal government. One focus was on the role veterinary labs, including those with special certification, could play in helping to build capacity. \"Five veterinary labs have their CLIA certification to officially test human patients,\" he said. \"There are a lot of labs who are doing surveillance testing that don't need the CLIA certification.\"\nHe was referring to certification under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, a federal law that sets the standard for labs that test human specimens.\nSo that got us wondering: Can labs that test cattle, chickens or your pet Fido run tests on humans? And, if so, what role are they playing in the national pandemic, and how much is it helping?\nAfter all, the issue of expanding lab capacity will likely come up repeatedly as demand for testing increases with mounting case counts. Turnaround times at some labs have grown, with results now taking days to more than a week in some areas, frustrating consumers and public health officials. Delays for test results mean delays for contact tracing and quarantining. The administration\u2019s pandemic response, including testing issues, is also proving to be a hot topic on the campaign trail.\nWe reached out to HHS for more information about Giroir\u2019s statement.\nAn HHS spokesperson emailed a list of nine veterinary labs that have received the required certification to do patient-specific human testing, saying Giroir had been mistakenly briefed before the interview that there were only five. A U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesperson said there are 15 National Animal Health Laboratory Network facilities nationwide that have CLIA certification to test human samples. Clearly, there are vet labs in the U.S. with the necessary credentials, but the exact number is a matter of confusion.\nAs for the surveillance efforts, the HHS spokesperson did not provide specific examples of veterinary labs doing such work but provided a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services FAQ saying labs that don\u2019t have CLIA certification can do some types of surveillance if results are not given to specific patients.\nSimilar science, same machines\nOur experts all quickly noted that veterinary labs \u2014 especially those that focus on food animals, including cows, pigs and chickens, have long tested for diseases, including many kinds of coronaviruses.\nThey\u2019re on the lookout for microbes that can affect food safety, such as salmonella or E. coli, or diseases that can devastate the animals themselves, including avian influenza, hoof and mouth disease or African swine fever.\nHence, a lot of testing goes on in the 63 food-animal testing labs in 33 states and four Canadian provinces accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, said its executive director, David Zeman.\n\"In some states, we have more capacity in the vet labs than in the public health labs,\" he added.\nThose vet labs, often affiliated with universities or government agencies, use highly sophisticated equipment, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, as do labs focusing on human testing. Many of the COVID tests being done are PCR, which can detect the virus\u2019s genetic material.\n\"It\u2019s the same machines, the same science,\" said Zeman.\nHowever, these are large, full-service labs that deal mainly with farm animals, different from the smaller labs generally found at your neighborhood vet. So, sorry, Fido.\nA different regulatory chain of command\nEarlier this year, researchers at Iowa State University found that the testing process for the new coronavirus is similar to that used to test pigs for porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus, a disease that killed thousands of piglets in 2013. Because a lot of labs had updated their equipment and processes so they could check for PED, they were in a good position to help with COVID-19 testing.\nExcept, of course, it\u2019s never that simple.\nWhile the science and technology are the same, the administrative requirements are not.\nVeterinary labs must meet standards for accreditation by such groups as the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians and are overseen by federal and state agricultural agencies.\nHuman labs also must meet strict standards, including CLIA, and fall under the auspices of other agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nOne requirement is that the CLIA lab must have a director who is a medical doctor with specialized experience. Most animal labs are run by, not surprisingly, veterinarians, often ones with Ph.D.s. Some vet labs have formed partnerships with CLIA-certified labs to clear this hurdle. Still, it\u2019s a process that can take weeks, so it\u2019s not an overnight fix, said Zeman.\nRunning the numbers\nBut can these labs really make a difference in the testing backlog?\nA June article on the American Veterinary Medicine Association website quoted an official in May saying that the then-seven CLIA-certified vet labs had the capacity to process 12,000 PCR samples with a 24-hour turnaround.\nZeman said he sent out a survey in July to his 63 members in response to an HHS inquiry and found that, on average, each lab \u2014 if CLIA-certified \u2014 could process 500 to 1,000 COVID samples a day on top of what it needs to do to monitor animals.\n\"Multiply that by 60 some labs and you have a rough idea of what they could do,\" he said. The math adds up to at least 31,500 tests a day.\nCurrently, more than 700,000 samples are taken daily and sent to all types of labs \u2014 mainly large commercial and hospital-based facilities, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University. The Atlantic\u2019s COVID Tracking Project notes similar testing numbers at the end of July.\nMore vet labs participating \"could ease the burden on these labs, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a game changer in terms of wait times,\" said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\nSome vet labs are working with public health labs to \"test a specific segment of the population (university students, routine screening of government workers, etc.),\" said Michelle Forman, media manager for the Association of Public Health Laboratories in an email. \"So it\u2019s not so much taking existing burden off of the public health labs and commercial labs but it is preventing additional burden from being put on them.\"\nGiroir said \"lots\" of labs that are non-CLIA certified labs are helping by doing research or\u00a0 surveillance, but Zeman was not aware of such efforts by such labs in his organization.\nPerhaps Giroir was talking about \"pooled testing,\" in which a number of specimens are tested in a batch, speculated Mark Ackermann, director of the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon. Under that method, if any batch tests positive, individual specimens from the batch are then each tested to see who is positive.\nAckermann, whose lab has CLIA certification, pointed to another way vet labs might be helping: Many are making the liquid needed for the vials that hold the swabs taken from patients\u2019 nasal passages.","cleaned_claim":"Five veterinary labs have their CLIA certification to officially test human patients.

In addition, the article highlighted a study that found access to firearms increases the likelihood of assaults against family members and others to whom people are close, such as girlfriends or boyfriends, escalating to homicide.\nThat 1992 study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found death was 12 times more likely if such assaults involved a firearm than if the assault did not involve a firearm.\nHowever, neither the study nor the article states that guns are 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or assault than they are for self defense.\nSo, where did the number come from?\nWell, if Soglin added all of the numbers \u2014 three times the risk for suicide, two times the risk for homicide and 12 times more likely for a family and intimate assault to escalate to homicide \u2014 he would have gotten 17.\nBut the numbers cannot be added together -- family and intimate assaults that escalate to homicide are already accounted for under homicides as whole.\nIn addition, none of these numbers compare the use of a gun for self-defense with the risk of homicide or suicide, which was the focus of Soglin\u2019s claim. The studies compare the risk of gun ownership to non ownership.\nAre there other studies that are on point?\nAccording to a 2014 analysis in the Annals of Medicine that examined 16 published studies, people in the United States with access to a firearm are three times more likely to die by suicide than those who do not have access, and are two times more likely to die by homicide. This study made no mention of family or intimate assaults, and did not make comparisons with self defense.\nWe could not find any recent studies comparing how often guns are used for suicide and assault vs. how often they are used for self defense, but there is a 20-year-old study that comes close to corroborating Soglin\u2019s claim.\nThat 1998 study by A.L. Kellermann with the Emory University Center for Injury Control said for every time a gun is used in the home for self-defense or legally justifiable shootings, it is used four times in an unintentional shooting, seven times in a criminal assault or homicide and 11 times in an attempted or completed suicide.\nThe study found a gun is 18 times more likely to be used in an attempted or completed suicide, homicide or assault than it is for self-defense. But some of these homicides may involve strangers and, therefore, it would not be entirely accurate to say this study supports Soglin\u2019s claim about the danger to known victims.\nWhat\u2019s more, gun laws, ownership and crime rates have changed since this study was completed, so its findings may be out of date.\nFinally, Soglin\u2019s larger point about guns being used infrequently for self defense is generally accurate.\nA study done using federal crime and victimization statistics by the Violence Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based organization dedicated to stopping gun deaths and injuries, found that between 2007 and 2011, there were 29.6 million victims of an attempted or completed violent crime. Of those victims, 235,700 used a firearm as a form of self defense. That means about 0.8 percent of attempted or completed violent crimes involved a victim using a firearm as a form of self-defense.","cleaned_claim":"If there is a firearm available, it is 17 times more likely to be used either for suicide or for assaulting a friend, relative, an acquaintance than it is to be used in fending off an intruder.","ambiguity_score":0.6149895191,"paraphrases":[["If a gun is present, it is much more likely to be used in a suicide or to attack a friend, family member, or acquaintance, than to be used in self-defense against an intruder.",0.0250167791],["If a gun is available, it is far more likely to be used in a suicide or to attack a friend, family member, or acquaintance, than to be used to defend against an intruder.",0.0327573121],["If there is a firearm in the home, it is far more likely to be used to commit suicide, or to assault a friend or relative, than it is to be used to protect the home from an intruder.",0.3460901678],["If a gun is available, it is 17 times more likely to be used for suicide or to attack a friend, family member, or acquaintance than to be used to defend against an intruder.",0.0266855787],["If there is a firearm in the home, it is 17 times more likely to be used in a suicide or to assault a friend, relative, or acquaintance, than it is to be used to defend against an intruder.",0.6149895191]]}

John Culberson \"was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils.\"","person":"Environmental Defense Fund Action","venue":"stated on October 29, 2018 in a mailer to Texas homes:","justification":"Environmental Defense Fund Action said Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson \"was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils.\"\n\"Caught\" seemed strong to us at first, given the campaign\u2019s denials. But with a phone call and email, it turned out that Culberson had in fact used campaign funds -- not for fossils, but for replicas and a desktop model.\nOur ruling comes down to perspective. The mailer\u2019s spin seemed a little strong at first, especially knowing that gift purchases, whether for Civil War trinkets or not, are allowable if considered of nominal value. But the insistence of the campaign that Culberson did not buy fossils -- and that he had only bought books and maps -- is a factor as well. OK, he didn\u2019t buy fossils. He bought fossil replicas. We rate the claim Mostly True.","full_article":"As the 2018 campaign comes to a close, the political arm of the Environmental Defense Fund has sent a mailer to homes in Texas\u2019 7th Congressional District saying that John Culberson, a Republican congressman, is \"wrong for Houston.\" As partial proof, it said he was \"caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils.\"\n\"Caught\" is an interesting word, since the nine-term incumbent, now challenged by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, disclosed the memorabilia purchases, which he says he gave as gifts from his campaign. As for the fossils, his campaign insisted there were no such purchases -- and said it only bought books and maps from a business that happens to also sell fossils. Critics have made a false assumption, the Culberson campaign told us initially.\nWe\u2019ll look at both parts of the claim but will give away a bit of what we found right here: He bought fossil replicas.\nIf you wonder why an environment group would care about fossils and Culberson, the group noted that Culberson said in late summer that his purchases were for research into such things as paleoclimatology, or the study of climates before instrumental records were widely available, to help him better understand climate change. Environmental Defense Fund Action says that for all this studying, Culberson still refuses to accept scientific research on the matter. Culberson has said humans played a role in climate change but, as he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015, \u00a0\"We just don\u2019t have enough data or accurate data to say with certainty what that effect has been.\"\nFossils\nLet\u2019s take fossils first. The congressman\u2019s critics based their claim on a mention in a 2012 campaign finance report that Culberson\u2019s campaign made two purchases from a South Dakota organization, the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research.\nThe institute sells fossils, replicas and other things, and Culberson spent $309.66 altogether there, Federal Election Commission records show. The purchase was part of a broader set of Culberson expenses being questioned by Texas Democrats -- a set of questions we are not addressing fully here because we are looking specifically at campaign ads and claims. But for a bit of perspective, the Houston Chronicle wrote in August that Texas Democrats were challenging nearly $50,000 in Culberson campaign spending since 2004.\nFocusing just on fossils, PolitiFact asked Culberson\u2019s campaign what it bought from the Black Hills Institute. We were told it bought books and maps, not fossils, the same explanation the campaign has given since August.\n\"Only in politics does a person get attacked for trying to be better at their job,\" Culberson campaign spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said. \"The mailer from the Environmental Defense Action Fund is factually wrong. The congressman never bought fossils with campaign contributions and all other purchases are acceptable under House and FEC rules.\"\nCulberson is a voracious reader, and has spent thousands of dollars from his campaign account for books and materials, including some on paleoclimatology, that his campaign says were related to his job. In just the 2011-12 campaign season, Culbserson\u2019s campaign spent $9,848 on \"research\" or \"research materials,\" most of it from vendors such as Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, FEC records reviewed by PolitiFact show.\nCulberson chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on science and such agencies as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The research material helps him better understand the changing levels of carbon dioxide in the climate, his campaign says.\nAsked about records that would show he was buying books and maps, not fossils, from the Black Hills Institute, his campaign said the 2012 records for such specific purchases no longer exist.\nWe\u2019ve got the receipts\nPolitFact, however, called the Black Hills Institute. They pulled the invoices from Culberson's two separate orders\u00a0and sent us copies.\nThis is what the campaign paid for, excluding shipping charges:\nThree large wall charts showing extensive histories of the Earth and matter, dating back 4.5 billion years. The charts have columns showing tectonic maps, changes in the earth such as mountain formation, major volcanic eruptions, glacial epochs, craters from asteroids and comets and extensive information on fossils, invertebrates and vertebrate lifeforms, as well as their extinction. These cost $19.95 apiece.\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPam Keith\n\n\nstated on May 8, 2022 in a tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTennessee just banned Plan B and made it a crime punishable by a $50,000 fine to order it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Samantha Putterman \u2022 May 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne desktop model of a Triceratops. It cost $84.05.\n\n\nTwo large -- 4.5 inches -- fossil replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth. Each cost $40.\nThe FEC gives \"pretty wide latitude\" to the purchase of books and other materials that a candidate or officeholder might use in his or her official capacity, Brendan Fischer, an expert on campaign finance law at the Campaign Legal Center, told us. But what about a Triceratops model and replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth fossil?\n\"I\u2019d like to hear their explanation for it,\" he said. \"It\u2019s hard to see how it would pertain to their official duties.\"\nWe told the campaign what we found, and it asked what our proof was. So we sent the campaign the invoices for the congressman\u2019s purchases. The response from Kelly, the spokeswoman:\n\"The invoices confirm that the congressman never bought actual fossils, and every purchase from the Black Hills Institute is considered acceptable under House and FEC rules.\"\nAsked why the congressman bought the replicas and the model at all, Kelly said, \"While these purchases were more than six years ago and now being used as part of a coordinated partisan hit job, the congressman believes these particular purchases were gifts, which is completely acceptable under FEC and House rules.\"\nCollectibles\nThe mailer from Environmental Defense Fund Action also mentioned Culberson\u2019s use of campaign money to buy collectibles and Civil War memorabilia. This, too, originated from the Democrats\u2019 complaint referenced in the Houston Chronicle. Culberson is a Civil War history buff, collector and sometime-seller of memorabilia.\nBut when it comes to his campaign funds, the purchases were for items such as stamps and coins the congressman got in order to give out as gifts, his campaign said. Congress members frequently use campaign money to buy gifts for constituents and volunteers, and the Culberson campaign said the Texas Republican was doing nothing different from what House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has done when buying white orchids.\nThe FEC allows candidates and officeholders to buy and give as gifts items of nominal value as long as they are not given to family members, Fischer said.\nFEC reports show only what a candidate or officeholder pays, not the value of the each item. For example, in 2014, Culberson\u2019s campaign spent $3,631 on coins from an antique coin seller. In 2009 and 2010, the campaign spent $4,181 on antiques and coins for gifts, including hat stars \u00a0(an emblem worn on soldiers\u2019 hats) and Texas Centennial and Republic of Texas coins, FEC records show.\nCulberson\u2019s campaign said the value of each coin was about $25, and the value of stamps was about $10.\nFor a broader view, we downloaded FEC data showing all federal candidate purchases -- those for everyone with a federal campaign account -- of items listed as \"gifts\" just since January 2017. The total reached $1.8 million, for everything from model airplanes to a quilt to gift baskets.","cleaned_claim":"Texas U.S. Rep.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., was asked about how his constituents feel about the government shutdown and the immigration policy dispute that caused it.\nIn the Jan. 8 interview -- conducted a few weeks before President Donald Trump and congressional leaders ended the shutdown -- Manchin said some West Virginia residents are concerned about losing the flow of federal checks and about legal immigration visas.\nHe prefaced these comments by noting how popular President Donald Trump is in his state.\n\"President Trump has the strongest support percentage-wise in our state than any other state in the nation,\" Manchin said. \"He won West Virginia by almost 43 percentage points, and he's been carrying close to 60 percent approval.\"\nJust how supportive of Trump is West Virginia? Let\u2019s break down Manchin\u2019s statement into three parts.\n\"President Trump has the strongest support percentage-wise in our state than any other state in the nation.\"\nIt\u2019s clear that West Virginia is at or near the top, but it\u2019s hard to say for sure if they are No. 1.\nWhen we reached out to Manchin\u2019s communications director, Jonathan Kott, he said the senator was referring to the 2016 election results. However, Manchin used the present tense to describe Trump\u2019s level of support in the state, and two years after the 2016 election, Trump\u2019s election results are no longer an up-to-date measure of his support levels.\nSo we turned to state-by-state ratings by Morning Consult, the only survey group today that offered recent presidential approval scores in all 50 states at the time Manchin made his remarks. The most recent figures are from December 2018.\nBy this measure, West Virginia actually ranks No. 2 in the nation, according to the most recent report. The December 2018 approval rating for Trump reached 61 percent in West Virginia, but that was a few points below Wyoming, with 64 percent.\nThat\u2019s within the poll\u2019s margin of error, which ranges from one to five percentage points depending on the size of the state. This means that West Virginia and Wyoming are effectively neck-and-neck in Trump approval -- but Alabama and possibly Mississippi (at 58 percent and 56 percent, respectively) could also be neck-and-neck with West Virginia.\n\"He won West Virginia by almost 43 percentage points.\"\nThis part of his remark refers to actual electoral results in 2016.\nTrump won 67.85 percent of the vote in West Virginia in 2016, with Hillary Clinton taking 26.18 percent. That\u2019s a difference of 41.67 percentage points. So he\u2019s off only slightly.\n\"He's been carrying close to 60 percent approval.\"\nManchin is on target here -- in the December Morning Consult survey, Trump had a 61 percent approval rating in West Virginia, meaning that Manchin actually understated the figure slightly.\nEarlier polls were in the same range. A WVMetroNews\/The Dominion Post poll in September 2018 found 60 percent approval for Trump, while an October 2018 poll by WSAZ and Gray Television found 58 percent approval.","cleaned_claim":"President Trump has the strongest support percentage-wise in our state than any other state in the nation.

And the overall impression created by the ad is consistent with Trump\u2019s messaging over the preceding month and a half.\nAs health officials and politicians alike have pushed for more testing, Trump has expressed increasing doubts as to its importance, progressing from calling it \"overrated\" to calling for the slow down. Though White House officials defended that as a joke, Trump at one point contradicted that, while at another saying he didn\u2019t mean it.\nWe rate this claim True.","full_article":"Months into the coronavirus pandemic, much remains unknown about the virus\u2019 origins, transmission and longevity.\nBut the need for more testing is a point of near unanimous agreement among health officials, scientists and members of both political parties. It\u2019s the pathway to better understanding how far the disease has spread, how common severe cases are and how best to address it.\nSo is the president pushing to limit testing?\nA new attack ad from Priorities USA targeting Wisconsin and other battleground states makes that claim with a series of quotes from President Donald Trump. Over the mandatory ominous music, the ad plays four Trump quotes asserting testing is making America look bad, so we should slow it down.\nAds in this style have been known to pull quotes out of context or rearrange them chronologically to create a more compelling narrative.\nThat didn\u2019t happen here.\nAmerica has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world \u2014 with 2.3 million as of June 24, 2020 \u2014 and has also done the most testing in the world, in terms of raw numbers. Across the nation we are conducting about 500,000 tests per day now, double where we were in early May, according to covidtracking.com.\nThat said, many countries have done more testing on a per-capita basis, as detailed by Johns Hopkins University. Throughout the pandemic the U.S. has averaged about 56 tests per day per 100,000 people. Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia have all tested at a higher rate, and Russia and Qatar are among a handful of countries that have topped 100 daily tests per 100,000 people.\nTrump has boasted of the volume of testing in the past, saying America\u2019s testing is the best in the world and that the high number of confirmed cases is a \"badge of honor.\"\nBut since May, the president has also increasingly pushed back against testing, calling it \"overrated\" and noting the bad optics associated with the higher case counts. He took that line of reasoning a step farther in his latest comments, as detailed in the ad.\nHere are the four quotes in context.\n\u2018By doing all of this testing we make ourselves look bad.\u2019\nTrump said this May 6, 2020, during a meeting with Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds.\nThe quote\n\"The media likes to say we have the most cases, but we do, by far, the most testing.\u00a0 If we did very little testing, we wouldn\u2019t have the most cases. So, in a way, by doing all of this testing, we make ourselves look bad.\"\nThe context\nReynolds \u2014 a Republican \u2014 responded to Trump by highlighting the importance of testing: \"That really provides us the data we need to understand the virus activity better.\" Trump, meanwhile, has made numerous similar comments, including a June 19, 2020, Wall Street Journal interview where he called testing \"overrated\" and said \"in many ways, it makes us look bad.\"\n\u2018When you test you find something is wrong.\u2019\nTrump said this May 14, 2020, during an appearance in Pennsylvania.\nThe quote\n\"Don\u2019t forget, we have more cases than anyone in the world, but why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn\u2019t do any testing, we would have very few cases.\"\nThe context\nTrump asserts there would be fewer cases if there were less testing. Of course, less testing would simply mean officials are aware of less cases, or there would be fewer identified cases \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t mean fewer cases exist.\nBut this line of thinking is consistent with other comments from the president, including a May 15, 2020, event where Trump said, \"If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases,\" and \"Maybe it (testing) is overrated.\"\n\"Testing is a double-edged sword. \u2026 So I said to my people, slow the testing down please.\"\nThese statements, used separately in the ad, are both from a June 20, 2020, rally in Oklahoma.\nThe quote\n\"You know, testing is a double-edged sword. We\u2019ve tested now 25 million people. It\u2019s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. German\u2019s done a lot. South Korea\u2019s done a lot. They called me, they said the job you\u2019re doing (trails off). Here\u2019s the bad part. When you\u2019re testing to that extent, you\u2019re going to find more people, you\u2019re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down, please.\u2019\"\n(Note: The U.S. has conducted more tests than any other country in terms of raw numbers, but the \"20 million \u2026 more than anybody else\" is wrong. Russia has conducted more than 17 million tests, according to tallies from Our World in Data)\nThe context\nVarious White House officials claimed Trump was speaking in \"jest\", was \"obviously kidding\" or was speaking \"tongue in cheek\" about slowing down testing. Trump himself has responded to this assertion multiple ways.\nOn June 23, 2020, he was asked specifically if he was kidding about slowing down testing. He responded, \"I don\u2019t kid. Let me just tell you. Let me make it clear,\" then went on to talk about America having \"the greatest testing program anywhere.\"\nBut in an interview that day with FOX News, Trump responded to a question\u00a0 \u2014 \"But you don\u2019t mean, do you mean slow down testing?\"\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0 by backing away from the statement and reiterating the idea that the U.S. would look better if it tested less.\n\"No I don\u2019t mean slow down, but if we did slow down \u2026 let\u2019s say instead of 25 million tests we did 5 million tests, we\u2019d be very low in cases right now, and everyone would say, \u2018Isn\u2019t that wonderful,\u2019\" Trump told \"Fox & Friends.\"\nDr. Anthony Fauci \u2014 part of the national coronavirus task force \u2014 said that day in testimony before Congress the federal government is trying to expand coronavirus testing, not slow it down. Fauci told the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \"None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing.\"","cleaned_claim":"President Trump said coronavirus testing makes the U.S. look bad, so I said to my people, \u2018Slow the testing down.\u2019","ambiguity_score":0.3135264814,"paraphrases":[["President Trump said that the high number of coronavirus tests being conducted in the US makes the country look bad.

Ted Cruz declared at the Republican Party of Texas convention as he took fierce issue with an Obama administration letter to public schools distributed the day before.\nIn the May 13, 2016, letter, federal agencies cited a decades-old federal law barring discrimination in educational settings as the basis for telling school superintendents nationally to let transgender students use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.\nCruz, fresh off his bid for president, told delegates: \"The president issued a decree to every public school in America demanding that they change their bathroom policies, demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into little girls\u2019 bathrooms. We have entered the world of politically correct lunacy.\"\nDid Cruz accurately sum up the Obama directive?\nTo our emailed request for the basis of Cruz\u2019s statement, Cruz spokesman Phil Novack said only: \"By the very text of the directive you linked, anyone in a public school, whether they are students or adults (which includes adult 18-year old students), would be able to enter any restroom.\" Novack also accurately noted the guidance also applies to colleges that accept federal aid.\nObama administration letter\nWe asked a Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, if the directive, particularly the portion on access to restrooms and locker rooms, would also apply to adults in schools.\nBy email, Nolt replied: \"Our guidance is related to students.\"\nFor our part, we noticed that the letter in question doesn\u2019t tell schools to let men into girls\u2019 restrooms; it doesn\u2019t say anything about adults in public schools. And its language about students is focused on transgender boys and girls whose gender identity doesn\u2019t match their sex assignment at birth.\nThe eight-page letter from the U.S. departments of Justice and Education tells school districts to be compliant with Title IX protections against sex discrimination by allowing students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with.\nThe letter, also affecting says the agencies are offering \"significant guidance\" on policies related to transgender students in relation to athletics, housing and overnight accommodations and education records, among areas.\nIn regard to restrooms and locker rooms, the letter states:\n\"A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex, but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity. A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so. A school may, however, make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek additional privacy.\"\nDefining transgender\nAnd what qualifies as \"transgender\"? Here\u2019s how the Obama administration letter defines it: \"Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender male is someone who identifies as male but was assigned the sex of female at birth; a transgender female is someone who identifies as female but was assigned the sex of male at birth.\" The letter defines gender identity as \"an individual\u2019s internal sense of gender. A person\u2019s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person\u2019s sex assigned at birth.\"\nThe National Center for Transgender Equality, a social justice advocacy organization for transgender people, says a transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Otherwise, the American Psychological Association defines transgender as \"an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.\"\nThen again, there are professionals who dispute such definitions. For instance, Paul McHugh, a psychiatrist formerly at Johns Hopkins University, said in a June 12, 2014, Wall Street Journal commentary: \"At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. \u2018Sex change\u2019 is biologically impossible,\" McHugh said. \"People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.\"\nBathroom debate\nDebate over whether a transgender person should use the bathroom aligning with his or her gender identity or gender assigned at birth picked up steam after North Carolina lawmakers in March 2016 passed a measure into law requiring people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate in public multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities.\nIn Texas in April 2016, the superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District, Kent Scribner, approved bathroom policy guidelines Scribner described as a call to meet the needs of the district\u2019s transgender students. Then on May 9, 2016, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick called for the superintendent to resign. Less than a week later, the Education and Justice departments sent their letter, which was met with a lawsuit, filed May 25, 2016, against the administration by Texas and 10 other states.","cleaned_claim":"Barack Obama issued a decree demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls\u2019 bathroom.","ambiguity_score":0.471257627,"paraphrases":[["Barack Obama issued a decree demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls\u2019 bathroom.

A federal court order in 1974 to integrate Wilmington schools brought the issue home for Biden. In the Senate, Biden began supporting much of the anti-busing legislation.\nUniversity of New Hampshire historian Jason Sokol, who tracked Biden\u2019s response to local opposition, has told us the amendments that Biden supported \"paint a somewhat muddled picture.\" Biden proposed some amendments that would have hamstrung desegregation while at other times he backed off.\nSokol told us after the debate that Biden\u2019s position on busing evolved but by the late 1970s he was decidedly against busing.\nBiden\u2019s claim that he was for integration but against busing doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, he told PolitiFact. \"By that point in history, there were very few school districts voluntarily integrating by other means, which is why judges were ordering busing. He is using disingenuous logic,\" he said.\nThe Biden campaign pointed to exceptions, including in 1974 when he voted to table an anti-busing amendment sponsored by Sen. Edward Gurney, R-Fla..\nThe amendment to an education bill was tabled by a single vote on May 15, 1974. The New York Times called the vote a victory for liberals.\nIn 1975, Biden supported an amendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, a North Carolina conservative who opposed civil rights, while stating he didn\u2019t share all the views of those who opposed busing.\nThe amendment was intended to prevent the federal government from collecting any data about the race of students or teachers in an effort to protect districts that refused to integrate.\n\"I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept that, in fact, does not bear any of the fruit for which it was designed,\" Biden said. \"If anything, it obfuscates the real issue today which is whether or not there is equal opportunity within the educational field for all people within the United States.\"\nBiden urged his colleagues to reject busing and focus on access to housing, employment, credit, and voting rights, wrote Brett Gadsden, Northwestern University historian and author of \"Between North and South: Delaware, Desegregation, and the Myth of American Sectionalism.\"\nWhen the Helms amendment defeated, Biden proposed an amendment to prohibit the use of federal funds to assign teachers or students to schools based on race.\nBiden said that his amendment would not preclude court-ordered busing, Gadsden wrote, making it an \"admission of a certain incongruity between his legislative efforts and the concerns of his white constituents who were concerned about an impending court-ordered busing mandate.\"\nThe Senate affirmed Biden\u2019s amendment by a vote of 50\u201343.\nBiden then introduced another amendment that narrowly targeted busing \u2014 rather than roundly forbidding all desegregation remedies. This amendment passed, too. The Senate passed the education bill with Biden\u2019s anti-busing amendments, but after the House-Senate conference they were dropped from the final bill.\nThe Washington Post this year cited an interview Biden gave to the People Paper, a Newark, Del., publication, in 1975:\n\"To 'desegregate' is different than to 'integrate.' . . . I am philosophically opposed to quota systems. They insure mediocrity.\"\nIn his book \"Promises to Keep,\" Biden recounted facing a group of constituents who were angry about busing during the 1978 election.\n\"Look, I told them, I was against busing to remedy de facto segregation owing to housing patterns and community comfort,\" he said, recounting what he told people in a high school gym in Wilmington. \"But if it was intentional segregation, I\u2019d personally pay for helicopters to move the children. There were howls in the crowd.\"\nBiden\u2019s campaign pointed to a news story about Biden in 1975 in which he defended busing in certain scenarios.\n\"In cases where a school system has racially segregated by gerrymandering district lines or by other legalistic means, Biden said he supports desegregation by any legal means at hand \u2013 including busing,\" according to the Wilmington News Journal. \"However, for school districts which are all white or all black \u2018because of historical pattern not involving segregation practices disapproved by a court\u2019 he is against busing.\"\nThe Biden campaign pointed to examples of African Americans, both in the past and this year, who criticized the idea of busing in major cities in the U.S.\n\"It was the biggest sham,\" said longtime Wilmington education activist Bebe Coker told the Delaware News Journal in April. \"It destroyed our community.\"","cleaned_claim":"I did not oppose busing in America.

The comments were confusing because he spoke in the present tense while talking about running for the Senate.\nBiden represented Delaware in the Senate from 1973 to 2009 before serving two terms as vice president with President Barack Obama.\nHere\u2019s what Biden said, with the lines lifted for the edited Facebook video in bold:\n\"You know, we have to come together. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running. I\u2019m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate, when I had run as a proud Democrat for vice president, and I\u2019m running as a proud Democrat for president.

Thank you.\"\nThe Facebook video omits nearly 30 seconds from Biden\u2019s remarks, including the moment where Biden said he is \"running as a proud Democrat for president.\" (The correct website Biden inaccurately referenced is https:\/\/iwillvote.com\/.)\nSimilarly out-of-context videos were shared by President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and some of Trump\u2019s media allies. In a segment about Biden on his TV show, Fox News host Sean Hannity showed a clip from Biden\u2019s remarks that was edited in nearly the exact same way as the misleading Facebook video.\nTrump tweeted twice about the moment and mentioned it during a campaign rally in Florida. His campaign has tried for months to advance the narrative that Biden is senile \u2014 a claim geriatrics experts said is wrong. They have falsely claimed Biden is staying in a basement to hide it.\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nBiden, who grew up stuttering, has made some verbal blunders on the campaign trail. But social media users have often deceptively edited his remarks to manufacture errors.\nOn the trail in South Carolina in February, Biden made a similar remark about being a Senate candidate.\n\"South Carolina is going to determine who the next president of the United States is going to be,\" Biden said. \"You really are. You\u2019re the ones that sent Bill Clinton to the presidency, and you're the ones that sent Barack Obama to the presidency. And I have a simple proposition here. I'm here to ask you for your help. Where I come from, you don't get far unless you ask. My name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out; if not, you can vote for the other guy. Give me a look, though.\"\nThe Trump campaign and his allies also seized on those comments. News outlets such as the Washington Post and Reuters reported that Biden misspoke.\nPolitico campaign reporter Natasha Korecki tweeted that Biden often closes his events by talking about his first campaign for Senate and reciting \"his old pitch\" from those days. A Biden campaign adviser retweeted a post making the same point. In South Carolina, Biden bungled the setup, the Washington Post\u2019s national political correspondent Dave Weigel later noted.\nBiden was using the same language during that first Senate campaign in 1972, and he has done so repeatedly since, according to the Associated Press. The Democratic National Convention showed a video of Biden using the \"look me over\" line while running for Senate.\nBiden made a less jumbled version of the same pitch to another group of Ohio voters in January, according to Cleveland.com.\nAfter talking about knocking doors as a 29-year-old Senate candidate, introducing himself and telling people to \"look me over,\" Biden fit the phrase to his current campaign: \"Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019m Joe Biden. I\u2019m seeking the Democratic nomination for president of the United States. Look me over. If you like me, help me out.

He also had some things to say about U.S. policy in Yemen.\nThe targeting of al-Qaida terrorists with drones has killed militants and civilians in recent years. And many Yemenis have\u00a0called on the Obama administration to end drone strikes, which Chafee refers to as \"extrajudicial killings.\"\n\"No more drone strikes,\" Chafee said in New Hampshire. \"One of the reasons I believe we\u2019re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues. That\u2019s what stirred up the population. That\u2019s what is happening in Yemen.\"\nThe New America Foundation has counted 114\u00a0strikes in Yemen, all but one since 2009, with 15 this year responsible for 57 deaths. The foundation bases this information on \"credible news reports.\"\nHave drone strikes turned the Yemen population against the U.S.? Is that the main issue?\nWe ask because there\u2019s been heavy fighting in Yemen over the past eight months between Houthi rebels and Yemeni government forces backed by Saudi airstrikes.\u00a0Cultural heritage sites have been destroyed. Food is in short supply. Rebels have chased the president from the capital city. And, according to a June 25 report in The New York Times, the warfare has displaced a million people.\nSo why does Chafee place such a heavy emphasis on U.S. drone strikes? We asked Chafee\u2019s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, to provide evidence to support the candidate\u2019s June 14 comments.\nAn article provided by Rich from The Long War Journal, a respected source on the fight against terrorism, tells the story of a Yemeni provincial deputy governor, also the son of a prominent tribal leader, who was killed by a 2010 drone strike.\nAt the other extreme, Rich also emailed an April 2014 Rolling Stone article, filled with the voices of Yemenis angered by U.S. drone strikes that have killed civilians. In addition, Peter Schaapveld, a British psychiatrist quoted in the Middle East Monitor, asserted that 99 percent of the people he met during a one-week visit to Yemen were suffering drone-related post traumatic stress syndrome. The fear of drones in Yemen, is \"traumatizing an entire generation,\" according to a quote in Rolling Stone.\nHowever, other experts we talked to say that what was happening in Yemen had a lot less to do with drones and a lot more to do with the war between militant Houthis, who are Shiite Muslims, and the current government, which is backed by the U.S. and by neighboring Saudi Arabia \u2014 a Sunni Muslim nation.\nBruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar with high-level foreign policy experience, including work for the Obama administration in 2009, wrote an analysis of the situation in Yemen one day after Chafee spoke. Riedel\u2019s analysis doesn\u2019t include a word about drones.\n\"It is safe to say that Yemen's civil war, the humanitarian catastrophe that it faces and the Saudi intervention in the country are not caused by drone strikes,\" Riedel told us in an email. \"Yemen's problems are much more complex than a result of the drones.\"\nA more recent NPR clip provided by Rich, from January, includes comments from another Brookings Institution expert, Ibrahim Sharqieh, who asserted that U.S. drone strikes had contributed to instability in the country.\nBut Sharqieh also blames the international community for ignoring the situation in Yemen over a two- to three-year period, not drones, when he talks about a solution to Yemen\u2019s latest tumult.\nAnother Yemen expert, Shaul Gabbay, a former\u00a0professor at the University of Denver, asserts that it\u2019s \"a very large leap\" to suggest that dissatisfaction with drone policy at the local level is an explanation \"for what is happening in Yemen.\"\n\"For example, the fact that Iran is interested in destabilizing Yemen from the much more important macro conflict, arising from the Shiite\/Sunni conflict, does not have anything to do with the specific use of drones,\" he said.\nAnd while surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center in other countries, including Pakistan and Jordan, have documented strong opposition to the targeting of militants with drones, no public opinion surveys have been done in Yemen.\nAnd the director of Pew\u2019s Global Attitudes surveys warns against making judgments about public opinion in the absence of a credible survey.","cleaned_claim":"One of the reasons I believe we\u2019re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues.

Only Utah can lay claim to being lowest in per capita production.\"\nWe know building homes in California can be a long, expensive process. But does the state really have the second lowest per capita housing supply in the nation?\nWe opened the door on a fact check.\nOur research\nNewsom is the frontrunner in a crowded race for California governor.\nHis campaign spokesman told us the statement is supported by an October 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute: \"A Tool Kit to Close California\u2019s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025.\"\nWe found the report \u2014 which Newsom cited later in his discussion at the forum \u2014 confirms the lieutenant governor\u2019s claim.\n\"California ranks 49th among the 50 US states for housing units per capita,\" the report said. \"Benchmarked against other states on a housing units per capita basis, California is short about two million units. To satisfy pent-up demand and meet the needs of a growing population, California needs to build 3.5 million homes by 2025.\"\nJohnathan Woetzel, a director at the McKinsey Global Institute, said researchers used 2014 data from the U.S. Census Bureau in their analysis.\nHe said the ranking cited by Newsom compares the ratio of people to housing units in each state. That specific ranking does not measure the pace of housing production over time, as the second part of Newsom\u2019s statement might imply. Woetzel noted, however, that California\u2019s pace of home building has significantly lagged behind other states.\nThe institute is the business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, a worldwide consulting firm.\nIts report found California had 358 housing units per 1,000 people, much lower than the U.S. average of 419 but slightly ahead of Utah\u2019s 347.\nSOURCE:\u00a0McKinsey Global Institute,\u00a0\"A Tool Kit to Close California\u2019s Housing Gap: 3.5 Million Homes by 2025\"\nNot a new phenomenon\nCalifornia has long failed to meet its housing needs, according to the report.\n\"Since the 1970s, the state has added 6.7 million households and 19 million people, but only 6.2 million homes. This means that over a 40-year period, the state added only 325 homes for every 1,000 additional people.\"\nTwo outside experts told us the McKinsey report is credible.\nCarol Galante, professor of affordable housing and urban policy at UC Berkeley, said California\u2019s low ranking \"doesn\u2019t surprise me.\"\nShe said California\u2019s housing production is stymied by the state\u2019s complex regulatory system, including the land-use discretion of local governments, combined with the high fees developers must pay and then pass on to buyers.\n\"The cost of building new housing in California is very expensive,\" Galante said. \"New development has to pay for all of its new infrastructure. That didn\u2019t use to be the case. In the 50s and the 60s and even through the 70s, we had a state system and a federal system that paid for the suburbs to be built through a public infrastructure.\"\nThere\u2019s also a problem on the demand side, Galante said, noting that wages aren\u2019t keeping up with the ability to buy new homes.\nJeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, added that Newsom\u2019s statement \"sounds accurate,\" and that the McKinsey report is credible.\nMichael cited California\u2019s regulatory climate as the biggest factor is slowing housing production.\nMore recent data?\nThe McKinsey report examined figures from 2014. We couldn\u2019t find more recent data comparing per capita housing units by state.\nBut we did find the total number of housing units produced in California in each year from 2014 through 2016. And based on the totals, it appears California\u2019s rank near the bottom of per capita housing supply is accurate given the relatively slow building pace, at least compared with pre-Great Recession levels.\nFor example, California added 69,000 units in 2014; 68,000 in 2015; and 89,000 in 2016, according to the most recent data available from the California Department of Finance, all while the state\u2019s population increased by roughly 300,000 per year.\nThose numbers are far less than California\u2019s home building peak of 2005, when 205,000 units were added.\n\"Before the housing bust, the lowest year on record was 1995, during which just shy of 75,000 units were built,\" notes a report from the California State Association of Counties.","cleaned_claim":"California is 49th out of 50 in the United States in per capita housing units.

Marco Rubio.\"\nThere\u2019s no actual statement from Hillary Clinton saying as much, so that part of the commercial is a stretch. The commercial does share some sources that quote Democratic politicians and operatives, and leans heavily on former Obama campaign director Schale, who wrote a blog post expressing some anxiety about Rubio. Schale, it\u2019s worth noting, favored Biden over Hillary Clinton initially. Baby Got PAC further puts a lot of faith in an anecdote involving Bill Clinton that is largely unsubstantiated.\nWith those caveats, it\u2019s still clear Rubio\u2019s campaign is a concern to strategists on the left. We rate the statement Half True.","full_article":"A Republican millionaire with an apparent fondness for '90s rap has thrown his support behind U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign.\nCalifornia winery owner John Jordan\u2019s new super PAC released a one-minute commercial before the Nov. 10, 2015, GOP primary debate. The political action committee is cheekily named Baby Got PAC, a reference to the 1992 Sir Mix-a-Lot magnum opus Baby Got Back.\nIn the ad, reportedly written by Jordan, a narrator explains the PAC is pulling for Rubio over the rest of the Republicans because the Floridian is the one that Democrats fear most in the general election.\n\"It\u2019s a tough choice. So you know who we asked? Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,\" the ad said while flashing three lines as proof of their point. \"For once, they told the truth. They admitted there\u2019s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s Sen. Marco Rubio.\"\nCue Sir Mix-a Lot: Now, we like checking campaign statements, and we cannot lie! But is this a charge Democrats just can\u2019t deny? (Sorry, we just had to get that out of the way.)\nWe should note we didn\u2019t find any instance of Hillary Clinton saying she was afraid of Rubio or any other candidate, and her campaign did not return our requests for comment. That\u2019s important to keep in mind, since the ad mentions her by name.\nSaying \"there\u2019s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton\" implies her campaign is unconcerned with the rest of the GOP field, which likely is not the case. A November 2015 story from the Daily Beast included Democratic donors and strategists saying Clinton\u2019s campaign was until recently more occupied with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and is now focusing on Rubio as Bush fades.\nFlorida-based Republican media consultant Rick Wilson produced the ad and confirmed with PolitiFact Florida where each of the three lines featured in the commercial came from. Let\u2019s take them one at a time:\n\"A Hillary Clinton match-up with Marco Rubio is a scary thought for Democrats.\" \u2014 the New York Times: On May 22, 2015, the New York Times published an article about Democratic strategists discussing Rubio, who announced his candidacy in April. The commercial\u2019s quote is the headline word for word.\nEvery source in the story at least acknowledged Rubio was a candidate worth addressing, while some said he would be a tough opponent. That\u2019s not to say Rubio is the only candidate they are worried about, which the ad comes close to implying, but the article highlighted his strengths in contrast to Hillary Clinton. For example, the New York Times piece said Clinton is working harder on winning the Hispanic vote.\nThe story included comments from 2008 Hillary Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle; Democratic strategist Christopher Lehane; former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and his millionaire donor John Morgan; former Florida House Democratic leader Dan Gelber and more.\nCrist, who lost a Senate race to Rubio in 2010, called Rubio\u2019s story of a blue-collar upbringing \"compelling,\" while Gelber said Rubio could make \"young women swoon, old women pass out, and toilets flush themselves.\"\nThe New York Times also interviewed Steve Schale, formerly Barack Obama\u2019s Florida campaign director, who had written a blog post about the state\u2019s Hispanic voters the same month the paper published its story.\nIn that blog post, Schale wrote:\n\"Marco Rubio scares me. I\u2019ve been pretty consistent on this one. If you are a Democrat, he should be the one you don\u2019t want to face, because I do think, if he is the nominee, he is the one who could significantly change the Hispanic math in Florida and the Latino math out west. Why? I truly believe he will benefit from the same identity politics that galvanized African American voters behind Obama.\"\nThat brings us to the next piece of evidence ...\n\"Marco Rubio scares me \u2026 If you\u2019re a Democrat, he should be the one you don\u2019t want to face.\" \u2014 Obama strategist to Cokie Roberts: This quote from Schale\u2019s blog post appeared in one of Roberts\u2019 syndicated columns with her husband, Steven. The headline on the column was \"Why Rubio scares the Democrats.\"\nNow, we must note Schale didn\u2019t say this to Roberts, as the PAC ad claims, and Schale told us he hadn\u2019t spoken to her. She only quoted him and linked to his post. Roberts pointed to Rubio\u2019s personality, storytelling ability and defense of his Hispanic heritage as strengths.\n\"Rubio is the best storyteller in the Republican field. The tales he tells \u2014 of his father the bartender and his mother the hotel maid \u2014 send a powerful message: I know what your lives are like. I'm just like you,\" Roberts wrote.\nThat jibed with what Schale thought, and still does.\n\"I definitely did say I'm scared of Marco, and I still think he's our party's biggest threat,\" Schale told PolitiFact Florida.\nKeep in mind, however, that Schale worked for the Draft Biden 2016 super PAC to convince Vice President Joe Biden to run for president. He thinks Rubio is a threat not just to Hillary Clinton, but to any Democratic hopeful.\n\"I believe he is their strongest candidate,\" he said.\n\"Bill Clinton believes Marco Rubio is Hillary\u2019s biggest threat.\" \u2014 Fox News: The ad is referring to author Ed Klein\u2019s Oct. 14, 2015, appearance on Fox & Friends. After the first Democratic primary debate, Fox interviewed Klein, who wrote the book Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary.\nDuring the segment, Klein described an anonymously sourced story from the book, in which Bill Clinton allegedly said Rubio was his wife\u2019s greatest challenger because of Rubio\u2019s age and appeal to Hispanic voters. (Fox News\u2019 online headline was \"Author: Bill Clinton Believes This GOP Contender Is Hillary's Biggest Threat.\")\nKlein\u2019s description of the incident in his book quotes Bill Clinton thusly: \"He\u2019s young, Hispanic, and a good speaker. He\u2019d pose a generational challenge (to Hillary, who will turn 69 in 2016) and a challenge for the Hispanic vote, which we need to win\u2026. We\u2019ve got to destroy him before he gets off the ground.\"\nThe author previously had written very critical books about the Clintons and the Obamas, and has faced criticism from both liberal and conservative camps over thin sourcing and sensational allegations. Bill Clinton\u2019s office told us it questioned Klein\u2019s credibility, and therefore the claim. A Clinton spokesman called Klein\u2019s version of events an \"alternate reality.\"\nBaby Got PAC is putting a lot of faith in one anonymously sourced anecdote for its ad. The story also doesn\u2019t constitute asking either Hillary or Bill Clinton directly whether they feel Rubio is a threat. But Klein insists the former president made the comment.\n\"I stand by the quote, which was related to me by a very reliable source who was in the room and heard Bill Clinton talk about Rubio,\" Klein told PolitiFact Florida.","cleaned_claim":"Hillary Clinton and the Democrats admitted there\u2019s one candidate who scares Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s Sen.

The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in November.\nHow Ohio voters feel about Trump heading into the midterms is of national interest following Trump\u2019s 8-percentage point win over Hillary Clinton in 2016. Former President Barack Obama had won the state twice.\nWhile polling has come under suspicion since the election, Renacci is citing valid polls. However,\u00a0he used a national poll to draw conclusions about Ohio GOP voters, something pollsters say isn\u2019t a great practice.\nMultiple polls show Trump continues to have strong GOP support, but he has much less support among voters in general. Renacci\u2019s claim that Trump has 58 percent overall support is probably too high.\nPolls in Ohio\nFor Renacci\u2019s claim that Trump had 85 percent approval among Republicans in Ohio, his campaign spokesman referred to a national CNN-SSRS poll.\nA December poll of 1,000 adults showed that 85 percent of Republicans had a favorable opinion of Trump. The poll showed that when both major parties as well as independents are included, 36 percent had a favorable opinion of Trump. The margin of sampling error was 3.6 percent.\nA couple of polling experts we interviewed took issue with Renacci using a national poll to express support by Ohio Republicans, although they noted polls show Trump has strong support among Ohio Republicans.\nWhen Renacci referred to Trump\u2019s 58 percent approval rating, that came from a poll specifically of Ohio registered voters.\nRenacci\u2019s campaign spokesman cited an online poll of registered voters by Axios\/SurveyMonkey done in February and March. The poll of 1,995 registered voters in Ohio showed overall, 54 percent of Ohio registered voters said they approved of the way Trump is handling his job as president. Among Republicans and independents who lean Republican, 93 percent approved. The survey\u2019s modeled error estimate is 4.5 percent -- so that\u2019s why Renacci cited 58 percent.\nWe looked at two additional polls of Ohio Republicans this year -- Fallon Research on behalf of a GOP advocacy group, and SurveyUSA on behalf of a TV station -- that showed 75 percent approval for Trump.\nBut polls consistently show far less approval when taking into account voters of both major parties and independents. Gallup\u2019s daily tracking found in 2017 that overall in Ohio, Trump had 45 percent approval. SurveyUSA found 41 percent overall approval.\nA pro-Renacci group, the Ohio First PAC, found Trump\u2019s approval among likely voters was 58 percent in April.\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said it\u2019s best to look at averages.\n\"I think the Renacci team is on solid ground suggesting an approval rating for Trump in the 80s for Republicans in Ohio, but I think 58 percent overall is probably unrealistically high,\" he said.\nTrump performed better in Ohio (51 percent) than he did nationally (46 percent), so it stands to reason that his approval in Ohio would be higher than it is nationally, Kondik said.\n\"If the national average is around 41 or 42 percent, I\u2019d think that probably means Trump is in the mid-to-high 40s in Ohio,\" Kondik said. \"That\u2019s about where I think it probably is.\"\nUniversity of Cincinnati associate professor of political science professor Steve Mockabee said that the 58 percent struck him as a little high.\nJennifer Duffy, who covers Senate rates for the Cook Political Report, said Trump's support among Republicans in Ohio is pretty solid and that 85 percent is in the ballpark.\n\"It is not something that should concern Republicans,\" she said.\nThe polling showing 58 percent among all registered voters is largely based on a turnout model and could be entirely correct for that model and not overstated, she said.\n\"The larger question is whether that model bears any resemblance to actual 2018 turnout,\" she said.\nOhio State University political science professor Vladimir Kogan said that whether someone identifies as a Republican can change over time, partly in response to Trump approval. He pointed to a 2017\u00a0working paper by the Emory University political scientists B. Pablo Montagnes, Zachary Peskowitz and Joshua McCrain, who argued that Republicans who disapprove of Trump stop identifying as Republicans.\nWhile Renacci made this claim in the context of a GOP primary, the bigger question is how the battleground state will vote in November.\nWhile Clinton was unpopular in Ohio, Brown has a long track record of winning statewide races.\n\"I\u2019m not convinced yet that just following a Trump playbook is going to result in a win,\" Mockabee said.","cleaned_claim":"President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio, and that's from recent polling, and still has a 58 percent approval rating in Ohio.","ambiguity_score":0.6073378921,"paraphrases":[["A recent poll showed that President Trump is still supported by almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in Ohio, and has an approval rating of 58 percent in the state.",0.0252012182],["President Trump's approval rating in Ohio is still at 58 percent, and he continues to have the support of almost 85 percent of the Republican Party in the state.",0.0142749194],["Despite some negative press coverage, President Trump still enjoys high levels of support from within the Republican Party in Ohio.

McCain was a last-minute holdout who bucked the majority of his party.\nAs for its impact on North Dakota, oil is a big industry and flaring a big issue, but the rule doesn\u2019t only target North Dakota. In fact, it mirrors already existing regulations with regards to flaring, while adding related provisions and strengthening oversight. It\u2019s also possible that North Dakota\u2019s own rules on flaring could supercede the federal regulations.\nWe rate this statement Half True.","full_article":"North Dakota Senate hopeful\u00a0Kevin Cramer\u00a0called out incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp for targeting North Dakota\u2019s energy industry.\nCramer, a Republican in the U.S. House,\u00a0told Hugh Hewitt during a radio interview that Heitkamp, a Democrat, \"cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota.\"\nCramer was referring to a vote to repeal a rule from former President Barack Obama\u2019s Bureau of Land Management\u00a0that places limits on the amount of methane gas that can be burned off or flared at drilling sites. (When oil is extracted, raw natural gas is also brought to the surface, so plants without the technology to harness the gas flare it.) We wondered whether Heitkamp had indeed cast the deciding vote for a rule targeting North Dakota\u2019s oil industry.\nIt\u2019s hard to say there is ever such a thing as \"the deciding vote\" with close calls in Congress. And Cramer is overplaying the rule\u2019s impact on North Dakota.\nHeitkamp\u2019s no vote\nThe Methane and Waste Production Rule was put in place in Obama's tenure\u00a0and had not yet been implemented when President Donald Trump took office. The vehicle for repeal was the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies with a simply majority within 60 legislative days of their issue dates.\nRepublicans held a 52-48 edge in the Senate, and needed only a majority to repeal the rule. But the motion was defeated 49-51 on May 10, 2017. Every independent and Democrat (including Heitkamp) opposed it, joined by three Republicans \u2014Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and John McCain of Arizona.\nHeitkamp's vote indeed was pivotal. She and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., were still publicly\u00a0undecided on the morning of the vote.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Heitkamp\u2019s vote was crucial. But as we have concluded in fact-checks of similar attacks, the \"deciding vote\" label could just as easily be applied to other lawmakers who voted no \u2014 making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the narrowly passed Affordable Care Act, for example.)\nHeitkamp\u2019s campaign argued there was a deciding vote, however, and it was McCain.\n\"One person surprised everybody,\"\u00a0Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Roll Call of McCain\u2019s vote against the CRA. \"I was very certain the votes were there because we wouldn\u2019t bring it up if the votes weren\u2019t there.\"\n\"In talking to folks, they were kind of going back and forth, undecided and then lean yes,\" John Hoeven, North Dakota\u2019s Republican senator, told Roll Call. \"And so we actually thought we had just enough. But as it turns out, we lost three, and we didn\u2019t get any help from the Democrats.\"\n'Designed just for North Dakota'\nCramer said the rule was designed just for North Dakota. It was not.\nIt targets flaring on all federal lands. The idea is that because the federal government receives royalties on federally owned fossil fuels, wasted methane equals lost government revenue. Republicans worried the rule was an unfair burden that would disincentivize producers.\nTim Rasmussen, Cramer\u2019s spokesman, clarified the senator was referring to the rule\u2019s disproportionate effect on the state.\n\"I would say it's designed for North Dakota because North Dakota has, over the course of this energy renaissance, the highest rates of flared natural gas in the country, BLM mineral ownership in the state making it applicable (unlike, say Texas), and just simply a widely reported on and discussed topic in the state (just like the Waters of the U.S. and Clean Power Plan),\" Rasmussen said.\nThe law indeed impacts North Dakota for these reasons. But Alexandra Teitz, one of the rule\u2019s architects, said the rule\u2019s flaring requirements were modeled after and designed to defer to rules in place in North Dakota, which unlike other states, was already addressing the issue.\nBoth the existing North Dakota state regulations and the bureau's\u00a0rule required operators to submit gas capture plans with their applications to drill, meet monthly gas capture targets, and allowed them to exclude some flaring from the gas capture targets.\nIn addition, the\u00a0rule included a key provision that allowed state requirements to substitute for the rule's requirements, if a state showed that their requirements would perform just as well in reducing waste. The bureau included this provision to avoid overlapping regulations in states that were already effectively addressing the issue.\nAs the only state with detailed flaring requirements similar to the federal department, North Dakota would have been the ideal candidate for this provision. Other\u00a0bureau\u00a0requirements to reduce leaks and venting would likely have stayed in place, as North Dakota has few requirements targeting those sources of waste.\nTeitz said that the rule would have also helped clarify regulation of flaring on tribal lands, which has been subject to some confusion.\nHeitkamp did express concern with the legislation and suggested alongside Manchin in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke that it be reviewed. They wrote that the rule included some Indian lands that were not federal lands and had the potential to provide more royalties without declining oil production.","cleaned_claim":"Heidi Heitkamp cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota.","ambiguity_score":0.0443148948,"paraphrases":[["Heidi Heitkamp was the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule.

MSNBC, among others, pounced. \"Ben Carson: Strip citizenship from non-citizens who vote,\" the headline on the Nov. 13, 2014, story said before wondering about the logic behind Carson\u2019s idea. \"If these are non-citizens, as the context suggests, how can they have their citizenship revoked? If they\u2019re citizens, where are they being deported to?\"\nThe MSNBC story cites a column WND.com published on Nov. 11, 2014: \"A common-sense prescription for immigration reform.\" When we visited the website on Feb. 5, the line was no longer in the column. However, it also appears in Carson\u2019s 2015 book, \"What I Believe: A Collection of My Syndicated Columns,\" under the title \"As Long as U.S. Leaders Game the System So Will Illegals.\"\nLet\u2019s look at the sentence in context. Carson said:\n\"As long as we reward people who break laws, they will continue to break laws. We do need a continual flow of immigrants, but choosers need not be beggars. We make decisions based on our needs. People who refuse to comply with the rules must forfeit chances of legalization in the future. Anyone caught involved in voter fraud should be immediately deported and have his citizenship revoked. The point is this: we must create a system that disincentivizes illegal immigration and upholds the rules of law while providing us with a steady stream of immigrants from other nations who will strengthen our society.\"\nNo states run their elections exactly the same, but across the country, citizenship is a requirement to to vote in U.S. elections. Noncitizens, including permanent legal residents, cannot vote.

Or exactly how late is too late to eat that apple?\nSo did comedian John Oliver. He used the July 19 episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight to discuss the issue of food waste, zooming in on little-known regulatory gaps that he argued cause mass confusion over the meaning and purpose of date labels on food.\n\"With the exception of baby formula,\" Oliver said, \"the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely.\"\nAnd of the 50 states, he went on, nine don\u2019t require any labels at all.\nThe confusing issue has been well documented over several decades, though we doubt it\u2019s ever been the target of an 18-minute monologue in a late-night comedy show.\nWe wanted to see if Oliver had it right.\nChaotic laws, confusing labels\nOliver was right in saying, with the exception of infant formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date.\nExperts say it would be almost impossible to set up an effective umbrella regulation for labeling foods with expiration dates. The diversity of climates and crops in the United States means it\u2019s hard to judge the pace at which different foods deteriorate in different places. A piece of fruit left out in the hot, humid fields of Georgia might spoil faster than the same piece of fruit left out in the cool, dry mountains of Colorado.\nIn the absence of an overarching federal statute, a jumble of laws at the state level dictate which foods require date labels.\nThe comedian\u2019s research team got the bulk of its data from a 2013 report compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental think tank, and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. The study found that most states have laws that require date labels on some foods.\nOliver cites the report\u2019s finding that nine states don\u2019t require any date labels, including New York, Idaho and Alabama. Of those nine, seven states don\u2019t have regulations that govern the labels that manufacturers voluntarily place on products.\nThese inconsistencies can make it hard to do business across state lines, said Emily Broad Leib, the study\u2019s lead author and director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. Laws in Montana and Pennsylvania require milk to be sold 12 and 17 days after pasteurization, respectively, but don\u2019t allow the milk to be donated if it goes unsold in that time.\n\"Without federal guidance,\" Leib said, \"some state laws require that (unspoiled) food be thrown away.\"\nThe Montana law prompted some out-of-state dairy farmers to argue that the law unfairly protects in-state producers.\nLabel it what you want\nThe regulatory gap also leads to confusion about what food labels actually mean. As a news clip in Oliver\u2019s segment illustrates, one might see the same product labeled \"sell by\" or \"use by,\" or it may have no label at all.\nMost retailers and manufacturers use a labeling system referred to as \"open dating.\" Though it might sound like a relationship status, \"open dating\" simply means that a calendar date is displayed on a product instead of a code that only makes sense to the producer.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the dates on these labels aren\u2019t regulated. This means it\u2019s entirely up to the manufacturer to decide what date to print on the labels in all 50 states. (The strictest federal regulation of this kind applies to poultry, but it allows the use of a packing date instead of a sell-by date.)\nThe purpose of manufacturers\u2019 date labels isn\u2019t to ensure safety, but quality, according to the USDA.\nOliver suggests that because manufacturers are free to determine their own best-by dates, they may have a financial incentive to falsify them. But one expert said he wasn\u2019t convinced manufacturers try to help out their bottom lines by making it seem like food perishes faster than reality.\nQuality standards almost always consider safety, said Keith Schneider, a food microbiologist at the University of Florida\u2019s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Keeping a customer happy means also keeping them safe.\n\"These dates are usually based on lab tests and historical precedents,\" he said.\nMost of all, he said, manufacturers want to build brand loyalty by consistently guaranteeing fresh, safe food, so they are often overly conservative with sell-by and use-by dates.\nLeib said it would be difficult to prove a producer manipulates its dates to boost profits, \"but it would be perfectly easy to falsify that information.\" Still, manufacturers have an interest in ensuring quality, and many times smaller companies don\u2019t have the money to test their products and apply accurate sell-by dates.\n\"Sometimes,\" she said, \"dates are just made up.\"","cleaned_claim":"With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely.","ambiguity_score":0.0455813296,"paraphrases":[["The federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, with the exception of baby formula.

Patrick Murphy says that U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s flip-flop on immigration reform will rip apart families.\n\"I worked with President (Barack) Obama on this topic while Sen. Rubio changed position,\" Murphy said in a Spanish-language ad Oct. 10. \"Now he opposes immigration reform. Worse, Rubio supports Donald Trump. His plan would deport 800,000 children, destroying families.\"\nMurphy, a Jupiter Democrat, is challenging Rubio, a West Miami Republican, in the Nov. 8 Senate race.\nMurphy\u2019s ad makes it sound like Rubio is against any changes to the immigration laws, but that\u2019s misleading. Rubio supports a different approach than the one he initially backed in 2013. The threat of 800,000 deportations under Trump also requires further explanation.\nRubio still wants changes (just not the kind Murphy wants)\nRubio has called for changing immigration laws for years, from his 2010 race for Senate to his unsuccessful presidential bid.\nHere\u2019s how he changed course.\nIn 2013, Rubio and seven other senators unveiled bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The law required beefed-up border security before unauthorized immigrants could pursue legal status.\nBut House leadership wouldn\u2019t bring the bill up for a vote, so it died. Within months, Rubio said that a single comprehensive immigration bill was \"not realistic\" and instead called for a piecemeal approach starting with border security first.\n\"Such measures would include securing the most vulnerable and most trafficked sectors of the southern border, mandatory E-Verify and the full implementation of an entry-exit tracking system,\" Rubio wrote in his 2015 book American Dreams.\nMurphy\u2019s spokesman argues that Rubio\u2019s support for reform contingent on first \"securing the border\" is intangible and vague.\nAlex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us in 2015 that Rubio\u2019s piecemeal proposal is a \"stylistic rather than a substantive change.\"\nDaniel Costa, an immigration expert at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, told PolitiFact that Rubio\u2019s approach counts as reform \u2014 but there\u2019s concern Republicans could try to leave out the \"piece\" that includes a path to citizenship.\n\"If all the necessary pieces get done, there\u2019s no problem,\" Costa said. \"But I don\u2019t know of any good reasons to advocate for piecemeal unless you don\u2019t want one of the pieces.\"\nWhose plan is it anyway?\nThe part of the ad about 800,000 deportations refers to people who were brought to the United States illegally as children, called Dreamers by advocates.\nRubio spoke against the DREAM Act in 2010 when he was running for U.S. Senate but later showed interest in finding a bipartisan solution to help Dreamers obtain legal status.\nIn 2012, Rubio was working on legislation for this group, but that came to a halt when Obama announced his executive action for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals allowing Dreamers to temporarily avoid deportation. Without the program, they could be deported.\nData through June from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services show 741,546 individuals nationwide have received deferred action. Of those, almost 30,000 are from Florida. (Murphy\u2019s ad includes the pending requests to bring the number up to 800,000.)\nRubio criticized Obama for bypassing Congress.\nIn 2015, Rubio said that he wouldn\u2019t undo Obama\u2019s program immediately because it would be disruptive, but he said that it would have to end eventually. In February 2016 he said that he would eliminate DACA on day one if elected president. On his Senate campaign website Rubio calls for cancelling Obama\u2019s actions.\nIf DACA is rescinded, Murphy argues that all of those with deferred-action status would get deported. But the particulars of enforcement would depend upon the administration. Certainly they would face a threat of deportation.\nHillary Clinton supports DACA but Trump says it\u2019s unconstitutional, pledging in an Aug. 31 speech he \"will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties.\"\nThe fate of those with DACA status would depend on whether repeal would mean immediate cancellation of status and the accompanying work permits, or simply non-renewal, said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration.\nIf Trump wins and rescinds DACA, immigrant advocates point to his call for mass deportation as a sign that Dreamers, too, would be deported. But Trump has made conflicting statements calling for mass deportation, then rejecting it and then saying there is a \"very good chance\" that it would happen.\nSome DACA recipients could face deportation faster than others.\n\"Those with removal orders would be threatened with immediate deportation,\" said David Leopold, past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"Those who don\u2019t face immediate deportation would face a very real threat of expulsion in the ensuing months.\"\nA lot of the DACA recipients\u2019 personal information is on file with the federal government, including their residence, which could make them easier to track down for deportation proceedings.\nWe asked Rubio\u2019s spokesman to provide more details regarding what the senator would want to happen to those with DACA status. He referred us to Rubio\u2019s comments in 2015 when he called for eventually ending DACA with hopes that by that point the government would have passed new immigration laws to include accommodating \"those people that have been in this country a long time, especially the young people.\"\nIt appears that Rubio doesn\u2019t want those immigrants deported. However, we are fact-checking whether his plan to rescind DACA would mean deportation for them \u2014 and they would face the threat of deportation.","cleaned_claim":"Marco Rubio opposes immigration reform.

The owner, Angela Marsden, had posted a viral video criticizing county officials for suspending outdoor dining.\nHannity later specified that he was talking about \"outside\" dining in California. But Ingraham\u2019s claim about restaurants was far more sweeping \u2014 and more wrong. It\u2019s inaccurate to say that \"there\u2019s no science\" to show \"restaurants are spreaders of COVID.\"\n\"There is a lot of information showing that restaurants are a high-risk environment,\" said Emily Landon, an epidemiologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago.\n\"Anytime people congregate, there exist increased opportunities for transmission should someone be infected,\" added Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. \"A restaurant is no different.\"\nFox News did not offer comment for this fact-check.\nIndoor dining is most risky, studies suggest\nThe risks associated with dining out vary based on the safety precautions the restaurants take and the coronavirus situation in their geographic areas. Many restaurants have become safer over time, but case surges in many states make running into an infected person more likely.\n\"It\u2019s hard to make universal claims because the pandemic is different in different parts of the country and even in different parts of the state,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \"In some parts of the country, restaurants aren\u2019t driving cases. In others, they have been identified in case investigations.\"\nCity data in Washington, D.C., for example, has shown restaurants and bars to be among the most common places for virus spread. Data in and around Los Angeles has been less clear.\nStill, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that COVID-19 has and can spread at restaurants \u2014 and especially at those that let groups of people congregate indoors without masks.\n\"Modeling studies have indicated that restaurants are high-risk environments for COVID-19 transmission,\" said Jason McDonald, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"In places like restaurants, people remove their masks to consume food and beverages, which increases the risk of transmission.\"\nOne CDC report in September, based on a survey of 314 symptomatic people who got tested for the coronavirus in July, found a link between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to locations with on-site eating and drinking options, such as restaurants.\nThe authors wrote that those with positive test results were \"approximately twice as likely to have reported dining at a restaurant\" than those who tested negative.\nIn a November study published in Nature, researchers at Stanford University and Northwestern University analyzed anonymized cell phone mobility data from 10 U.S. cities from March to May.\nFull-service restaurants, gyms and other crowded places accounted for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 infections, the study\u2019s simulations showed. \"Restaurants were by far the riskiest places,\" Stanford\u2019s Jure Leskovec, an author of the report, told reporters in November.\nPatrons enjoy food and drink at The Brass Rail in Hoboken, N.J., on Nov. 11, 2020. (AP)\nHow COVID-19 can spread in restaurants\nDining outdoors is safer than dining indoors, the CDC says, and restaurants with spaced out tables and limited guests are less risky than restaurants that aren\u2019t keeping patrons apart.\nThe virus is mostly spread from close physical contact, when people are exposed to respiratory droplets sent into the air as an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, laughs or breathes.\nBut there\u2019s growing evidence that infections may have also come from tiny airborne particles, especially in \"enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation,\" the CDC says. Shaman cited one recent study from South Korean researchers that looked at airborne spread in a restaurant.\nThe researchers examined the origins of one June cluster at a restaurant in the city of JeonJu. They found that, because of the way air was circulated in the restaurant, one person contracted the virus after just five minutes of exposure to an infected diner more than 20 feet away.\nOther studies have indicated indoor spaces carry higher risks of spread. The Atlantic highlighted one that showed the odds of transmission were nearly 20 times higher in closed spaces than in open-air environments. Landon shared with PolitiFact a powerpoint created for Illinois officials that listed several other studies, such as one examining an early outbreak on a cruise ship.\nRestaurants can reduce the chance of virus spread. Shaman recommended that they minimize or end indoor dining, limit tables and space them out, require waiters to wear gloves and masks, increase ventilation and keep surfaces clean. He also suggested that restaurants take down contact information for those who dine in case contact tracing needs to be performed.","cleaned_claim":"You know what the biggest lie is, is that restaurants are spreaders of COVID.

In reality, Pelosi has not specified what changes she would like to see in a replacement bill, so saying that she has vowed to raise taxes is an exaggeration.\nMeanwhile, if Schumer\u2019s proposal ends up being the model that Pelosi pursues, that approach could easily keep or expand tax cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers while raising them on wealthier Americans.\nWe rate the statement Half True.","full_article":"A headline popped up all over the Internet recently: \"Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House.\" How accurate is it?\nBased on the accompanying article -- originally published by the Daily Caller News Foundation, a conservative online publication -- as well as by additional reporting by PolitiFact, the headline outlines a scenario that\u2019s possible but speculative.\nThe April 5 article that accompanied the headline was prompted by a town hall on April 4 headlined by Pelosi and her fellow House Democrat from California, Ted Lieu, in Culver City, Calif. At the event, Pelosi and Lieu criticized the tax bill that passed last December, one advanced exclusively with Republican votes in Congress.\nAt one point, the article noted, Pelosi used a Democratic talking point that we have previously rated Half True -- that \"over 80 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent.\" That figure is correct for the tax law\u2019s impact by 2027, but through 2025, the top 1 percent\u2019s share is much smaller -- roughly 20 percent to 25 percent.\nHowever, the Daily Caller article did not specifically quote Pelosi promising to raise taxes. Rather, it offered a more nuanced scenario.\nPelosi didn\u2019t offer specifics when asked if Democrats would re-work the bill from scratch or focus on specific portions, saying instead her party would work openly with Republicans to reach a deal.\n\"One of our complaints about what they did with the tax bill is they did it in the dark of night with the speed of light,\" the California Democrat said.\n\"We\u2019ll sit down at the table and say \u2026 what would be a tax bill that creates growth, that creates good paying jobs as it reduces the deficit?\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it\u2019s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future,\" she added.\nIn other words, at the Culver City event, Pelosi said she would be willing to work with Republicans on overhauling or overturning the law in an unspecified way. Any tax hikes that result would be subject to negotiation -- and the changes could plausibly include cuts compared to current law for some Americans, rather than tax increases.\nOther remarks by Pelosi not included in the article reiterate this point.\n\"We can do, that we must do that, in a bipartisan way,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not about chipping at this piece or that piece, it\u2019s about a comprehensive look at what our tax policy should be for the future.\"\nMeanwhile, the article cites an earlier and more specific remark by Pelosi:\nPelosi\u2019s comments Wednesday come after she said in February that Democrats would have to \"replace and repeal\" the GOP tax bill once retaking the House.\n\"It may have to be a \u2018replace and repeal\u2019 \u2014 replace them and repeal the bill,\" Pelosi said.\nBut even this approach doesn\u2019t guarantee tax hikes, much less universal ones.\nMark Mazur, vice president for policy at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact that if you simply repeal the tax law \u2014 \"which really is impossible, since some of the provisions already have had an effect\" \u2014 you would raise revenue, or, in common parlance, raise taxes.\nBy contrast, Mazur said, \"if you replace it, then the character of the replacement determines whether the combined package raises or loses revenue.\"\nPelosi's office told PolitiFact that the headline \"an inflammatory misrepresentation.\" They pointed to a Pelosi press conference in December where she said any changes she'd seek \"would be bipartisan, open, transparent, and unifying as we go forward to strengthen middle class tax cuts.\"\nBottom line: It\u2019s premature to say a future Democratic-led change to the tax law would definitely raise taxes.\nIt would also be premature to say which, if any, taxpayers would see an increase under a potential Democratic bill. Democrats could vote to raise taxes in a way that keeps or expands the current cuts for lower- and middle-income taxpayers but raises taxes on the highest segment of earners. That\u2019s an important piece of context missing from the headline.\nOne proposal cited in the article was offered in March by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Schumer proposed raising the corporate tax rate from the newly enacted 21 percent level to 25 percent, by raising the top tax bracket back to 39.6 percent, by bringing back the alternative minimum tax, and by getting rid of the carried-interest tax loophole that benefits fund managers. The recent tax bill did not address the carried-interest provision.\nEach of these provisions cited by Schumer would target wealthier taxpayers.\nTo reach the conclusion of the headline requires \"a lot of reading between the lines,\" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\nOne last point: It takes more than a Democratic House to make changes to tax law. President Donald Trump has hailed the 2017 tax cut bill as one of his signature achievements. It\u2019d be highly unlikely he would sign off on any major changes, or that Congress would be able to overturn a presidential veto. In that sense, the entire discussion is somewhat academic.","cleaned_claim":"Nancy Pelosi vows Democrats will raise taxes if they take back the House.","ambiguity_score":0.0982290357,"paraphrases":[["Nancy Pelosi has promised that if the Democrats win back control of the House of Representatives, they will raise taxes.",0.0701191276],["Nancy Pelosi promised that Democrats will raise taxes if they win back control of the House of Representatives.",0.0453502163],["Nancy Pelosi has promised that, if the Democrats win back control of the House of Representatives, they will raise taxes.",0.0913373381],["Nancy Pelosi has promised that, if the Democrats take back control of the House of Representatives, they will raise taxes.",0.0982290357],["Nancy Pelosi has said that if the Democrats win back the House of Representatives, they will raise taxes.",0.0298835021]]}

Trump himself called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\"\nMulvaney\u2019s statement is partially accurate, but ignores important context. We rate it Half True.","full_article":"White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said he doesn\u2019t understand Democratic opposition to funding the border wall because top Democrats voted for it just over 10 years ago.\nDuring an April 23 segment on Fox News Sunday, Mulvaney talked down concerns about a government shutdown, but scolded Democrats for obstructing action on Trump\u2019s border wall. Mulvaney pointed to the voting record of top Democrats in 2006 to explain his confusion.\n\"We want our priorities funded and one of the biggest priorities during the campaign was border security, keeping Americans safe, and part of that was a border wall,\" he said.\n\"We still don\u2019t understand why the Democrats are so wholeheartedly against it. They voted for it in 2006. Then-Sen. Obama voted for it. Sen. Schumer voted for it. Sen. Clinton voted for it. So we don\u2019t understand why Democrats are now playing politics just because Donald Trump is in office.\"\nMulvaney is referencing their votes on an act that authorized a fence, but as we\u2019ve noted several times in the past, the 2006 fence was less ambitious than the wall Trump is proposing.\nThe Secure Fence Act of 2006\nThe Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico.\nThe act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles.\nAt the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.)\nObama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19.\nOriginally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement.\nCurrently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\nSo how does that compare to Trump\u2019s wall?\nTrump plans for the wall are vague, but here\u2019s what we know.\nHe said the wall doesn\u2019t need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher.\nExperts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people.\nStill, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trump\u2019s wall proposal.\nA 2016 Associated Press report from the border described \"rust-colored thick bars\" that form \"teeth-like slats\" 18 feet high. \"There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,\" the report said.\nTrump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign.\n\"Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,\" Trump said. (Actually, the project didn\u2019t face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim Mostly False.)\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too.\nDemocrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a Boston Globe report that detailed the legislative process. Around that same time, the House passed legislation that would make any undocumented immigrant a felon.\n\"It didn\u2019t have anywhere near the gravity of harm,\" Angela Kelley, who in 2006 was the legislative director for the National Immigration Forum, told the Boston Globe. \"It was hard to vote against it because who is going to vote against a secure fence? And it was benign compared with what was out there.\"\nDemocrats have described Trump\u2019s wall proposal as overkill and too expensive. Recently, Democrats penned a letter to Senate GOP saying border funding should not be included in the latest budget agreement to keep the government open.","cleaned_claim":"They voted for a border wall in 2006.

We rate the statement Half True.","full_article":"Critics of the House Republicans\u2019 tax bill have not only gone after its substance, but its process.\nDuring a markup of the bill by the House Ways and Means Committee, one Democratic committee member -- Rep. John Larson of Connecticut -- gave a stemwinder of an indictment that gained some currency on social media.\nComparing the House consideration of the current Republican tax bill unfavorably with the process that led to the landmark 1986 tax bill, Larson said that \"no one was allowed to come forward. ... No one from the administration will even sit in front of us. We are the oldest committee in Congress, many would argue the most prestigious, and members on this side of the aisle aren't even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy.\"\nWhen we took a closer look, we found that both parties have valid arguments to air.\nRep. John Larson, D-Conn., speaking at a\u00a0House Ways and Means Committee markup of the Republican tax bill.\nThe Republican case\nRepublicans argue that the committee has addressed many of the issues in the bills in previous hearings this year, all of which included opportunities for the minority to call one witness. (For Ways and Means hearings, the majority typically picks a few witnesses and the minority chooses one; sometimes the majority and minority agree to jointly appoint a witness.)\nHere are four Ways and Means hearings from 2017 that addressed issues at stake in the tax bill, along with the minority\u2019s choice of witness:\n\u2022 May 18, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on \"How Tax Reform Will Grow Our Economy and Create Jobs.\" Minority witness: Steven Rattner, former leader of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to revive the automobile industry.\n\u2022 May 23, 2017: Full committee hearing on \"Increasing U.S Competitiveness and Preventing American Jobs from Moving Overseas.\" Minority witness: Kimberly Clausing, professor of economics at Reed College.\n\u2022 July 13, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on \"How Tax Reform Will Help America\u2019s Small Businesses Grow and Create New Jobs.\" Minority witness: Chye-Ching Huang, deputy director for federal tax policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\u2022 July 19, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on \"How Tax Reform Will Simplify Our Broken Tax Code and Help Individuals and Families.\" Minority witness: Eric Rodriguez, vice president at UnidosUS, a Hispanic research and advocacy group formerly known as National Council of La Raza.\nDonald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee who now studies Congress at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said it would be typical for committees and subcommittees to debate bills and ideas with witnesses, and then hold a markup -- at which point new witnesses would not typically testify.\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth noting -- as the video of Larson makes clear -- there was one witness present at the markup, Thomas Barthold, the chief of staff of the Joint Tax Committee, the nonpartisan panel that does independent analysis of tax bills under consideration. The committee\u2019s staff director is almost always invited to weigh in before Ways and Means when considering a bill the committee has analyzed.\nWolfensberger said that, based on his own limited viewing of the markup in question, Barthold may have been a more effective witness for Democrats than they could have invited.\n\"The Democrats were certainly aiming a fair amount of tough questions at him, which he seemed to be answering in a very professional and knowledgeable manner,\" Wolfensberger said. \"I suspect they got more truthful and informative responses from him than they would have from partisan economists invited by both sides to put their best faces on the Democratic or GOP policy positions.\"\nThe Democratic case\nThat said, Larson also has some reasonable points to make.\nDaniel Rubin, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s Democratic staff, said that the earlier hearings had addressed theoretical possibilities for the tax bill, not the elements that made it into the bill the committee marked up.\nThe bill that was ultimately considered was \"much different than any of the outlines they had floating around earlier in the year,\" Rubin said. \"Democrats, including Mr. Larson, I presume, are frustrated that we never had a hearing with expert witnesses on how a repeal of the (state and local tax) deduction affects local economies, or how capping the mortgage interest deduction would hurt local housing markets, or \u2026 how $1.7 trillion in deficit spending might or might not drag down the economy.\"\nClausing, the Reed College professor who served as a witness for the minority, agreed.\nShe said she testified \"based on the prior legislative proposals, focusing in particular on the border tax, which is not part of this legislation.\" In general, she said, the process for the GOP bill has been \"way too quick for changes of this magnitude. No prior tax major tax bill has been done in such a rushed manner, with so little time for deliberation and understanding.\"\nFor instance, the official version of the bill was introduced on a Thursday, with markup beginning the following Monday.\n\"This was not as egregious as, say, the Senate's handling of the health bill, which ignored the core committees entirely, but it was a real and major deviation from what we think of as the regular order,\" said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\nRichard E. Cohen, a congressional reporter and author of a biography of the late Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, said that both sides have raised fair points.\n\"No doubt, the hearings were an opportunity to explore multiple aspects of the tax code, and it appears that Democrats had an opportunity to invite their own expert witnesses,\" Cohen said. \"It's also true that those hearings were months ago before many details of the current legislation had been filed, and that the current legislation was pushed through the House on an unusually expedited schedule with minimal bipartisanship.\"","cleaned_claim":"Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee weren\u2019t even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy.","ambiguity_score":0.1064210087,"paraphrases":[["The Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee were not allowed to bring in an expert witness to testify about any part of the tax code that affects the entire economy.",0.076596491],["Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee were not allowed to bring an expert witness to testify on any aspect of the tax code that affects the entire economy.",0.0711933374],["Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee were not allowed to bring in an expert witness to testify on any part of the tax code that affects the entire economy.",0.0771688223],["The Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee weren't given permission to bring an expert witness to talk about how the tax code affects the economy.",0.0635027364],["Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee weren\u2019t even allowed to bring in an expert witness to testify about any part of the tax code that affects the entire economy.",0.1064210087]]}

Jerry Brown offered an energetic rebuke to the Trump administration\u2019s \"alternative facts\" and \"blatant attacks on science\" in his State of the State address.\nThe solidly blue state voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton, prompting Brown to reflect on California\u2019s place in a broader national context in a speech traditionally used to set a state policy agenda. Contrasting Trump\u2019s positions, Brown promised to oppose deportations of undocumented immigrants, to protect health care and to continue to act on climate change.\n\"One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases. Our own voluntary agreement to accomplish the same goal \u2014 the Under2 MOU \u2014 has 165 signatories, representing a billion people,\" Brown said. \"We can do much on our own and we can join with others \u2013 other states and provinces and even countries, to stop the dangerous rise in climate pollution. And make no mistake, we are going to do exactly that.\"\nWe wanted to know more about what Brown was talking about and if it is accurate.\nThe Under2 MOU, or Subnational Global Climate Leadership Memorandum of Understanding, is a pact spearheaded by California and the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the leadup to the Paris agreement in 2015. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a \"game changer.\"\nIts 165 members represent about 1 billion people and pledge to limit carbon emissions to below 80 to 90 percent from 1990 levels with the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels by 2100.\nThat\u2019s the same goal and framework of the Paris agreement, the major international deal between nearly 200 nations. But there are a few differences between the two deals.\nFirst, Brown\u2019s numbers need explanation. Of the Under2 MOU\u2019s 165 members, 155 are signatories, meaning they've declared their commitment to limit emissions and to provide action plans. The other 10 are countries that have endorsed the MOU, meaning they support the goal but don\u2019t have to submit plans.\nSecond, the MOU is voluntary and nonbinding, and while the Paris deal is also voluntary, it includes binding obligations on reporting emissions and progress.\nThird, unlike the MOU, the Paris agreement has increasingly stringent targets for signatories. The United States, for example, pledged to cut emissions 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and then 26 to 28 percent percent by 2025 (equivalent to 19 to 24 percent from 1990 levels).\nDespite these differences, experts we spoke with said the Under2 MOU was a strong and forceful compact. But they said the MOU was a complement to the Paris agreement rather than its equivalent in terms of potential impact.\n\"They\u2019re part and parcel to each other. If you\u2019re driving those kind of reductions, those can help you get to the national targets. They\u2019re not distinct realms. They\u2019re nested within each other,\" said Brendan Guy, the international policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nUnder the MOU, California pledged to reduce emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and actually enacted legislation that codifies the target and sets a regulatory process in place. That\u2019s a \"really high watermark\" that hardly any national governments have met, said Danny Cullenward, an energy economist at Carnegie Institute for Science.\nExperts also pointed to California\u2019s five-year-old cap-and-trade program (which the Obama administration tried but failed to implement on a national scale), extended renewable portfolio standards and its pledge to get 1.5 million zero emissions cars on the road by 2025 as examples of strong climate change action.\nJust how far-reaching are these targets and policies? To state the obvious, cities and states do not account for all of a country\u2019s emissions, so their reduction pledges will not have an equivalent impact to a national commitment.\nCalifornia, despite being the largest state and equivalent to the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the United States\u2019 emissions. The other nine U.S. states that are part of the MOU (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont\u00a0and Washington) represent another 10 percent of the country\u2019s total emissions.\nLooking at it another way, if all 23,458 cities from the Energy Department's city energy profile tool enacted best energy-saving practices, it would lead to a 3 to 7 percent reduction in emissions, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\n\"Will these subnational efforts be enough to prevent a dangerous increase in average global temperature? Probably not,\" said Rachel Krause, a University of Kansas professor who focuses on local policy and sustainability. \"But they still can have meaningful impact.\"\nCullenward pointed out that the\u00a0Paris agreement\u2019s depth is the result of two decades of negotiations, while the MOU is a relatively new compact and will likely become much more sophisticated over time.\n\"It\u2019s no substitute for eventual national action. But it\u2019s a really appropriate strategy where you have national governments that aren\u2019t interested in taking action on climate change,\" he said.","cleaned_claim":"One hundred and ninety-four countries signed the Paris Agreement to control greenhouse gases.

Because of that, it could be expected the candidates, party committees and Super PACs would fundraise heavily. So we wondered whether Duckworth\u2019s repeated claims were true.\nSuper PAC influence\nSuper PACs can raise unlimited funds, but they cannot coordinate with a candidate or give directly to a candidate or a candidate\u2019s campaign. That type of outsourcing a campaign to another entity is illegal.\u00a0Citizens, corporations and organizations face strict limits on how much they can give when they give directly to a candidate. We asked Duckworth\u2019s campaign manager, Matt McGrath, what the campaign\u2019s source was for the claim that Kirk is \"outsourcing his campaign to a super Pac.\"\nMcGrath noted news stories referencing Independent Voice for Illinois, a Super PAC, or independent expenditure committee, run by Kirk\u2019s former chief of staff and former campaign manager, Eric Elk. McGrath said in an email, \"We deduced it by looking at its leadership and public disclosures of its donors, and independent entities who know this stuff inside and out, like opensecrets.org, have confirmed it.\"\nOpen Secrets, a nonpartisan project of the Center for Responsive Politics that tracks and tallies money in U.S. politics, does show the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC so far has raised nearly $1.3 million, spending $1.17 million against Duckworth and $117,000 in support of Kirk.\nElk has confirmed his involvement in the Super PAC in both the Chicago Sun-Times and Springfield State Journal-Register. He previously described the PAC as supporting the election of people who support \"common sense values\" of Illinoisans.\nFurther, the main contributors to the Independent Voice Super PAC are hedge-fund operators and employees as well as entrepreneurs. The Center for Responsive Politics recently took a deeper look at the Senate race in Illinois:\n\"Outside spending in the 2016 face-off has, thus far, disproportionately benefited Kirk. More than $1.6 million has been spent to back the incumbent or oppose Duckworth, while comparable outlays to help Duckworth come to less than half that, $713,901 to date.\"\n\"Chief among the active outside groups is Independent Voice for Illinois,\" the Center\u2019s story continued, \"which has spent a little less than $1.1 million to oppose Duckworth. The Super PAC has received $350,000 from employees of Citadel LLC, a hedge fund, and $250,000 from Elliott Management, a hedge fund management firm. Employees of both companies were also among Kirk\u2019s top contributors in 2010. To date, no single-candidate Super PAC has chipped in for Duckworth.\"\nBut the Duckworth campaign said Kirk had \"outsourced his campaign.\" Kirk is benefiting from heavy spending by the Independent Voice super PAC, but federal data show the Kirk campaign has raised $11.3 million and spent $8.4 million for his re-election effort, while Duckworth has raised $10.1 million and spent nearly $5 million so far.\nThat brings us to the third claim, that Duckworth does not have the support of a Super PAC. As the Center for Responsive Politics reported, no single-candidate Super PAC supports Duckworth, but, their story confirms, $713,901 has been spent by PACs and outside groups to support Duckworth. According to the Center, the Senate Majority Super PAC spent $384 against Kirk and in support of Duckworth and NextGen Climate Action Super PAC spent just under $1,000 against Kirk.\nNot all outside spending comes from Super PACs. Duckworth also has been the beneficiary of $623,379 in spending by a nonprofit called VoteVets.org. Super PACs have to disclose their donors, but nonprofit 501(c)(4) groups\u00a0like VoteVets.org do not.\n(Graphic\/data, courtesy of Center for Responsive Politics, www.opensecrets.org)","cleaned_claim":"Republican Mark Kirk is outsourcing his campaign to a Super PAC funded almost exclusively by a bunch of hedge fund billionaires. ...\u00a0I don\u2019t have a Super PAC.","ambiguity_score":0.5250591636,"paraphrases":[["Republican Mark Kirk is using a Super PAC, which is funded mostly by billionaire hedge fund managers, to run his campaign. ...

Regarding the first six, Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy told us Dallet \"has not shied away from talking about her common Wisconsin values of equality, fairness, clean air and water, and good schools. She does not advocate for specific policies to advance these values.\"\nAs we\u2019ll see, in the first three statements, Dallet singled out mass incarceration, the environment and fighting \"right-wing special interests\" as issues that she said need to be addressed, though she didn\u2019t advocate for specific policies.\n1. I\u2019m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration.\n2. Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment.\n3. I believe we (Burns and her) share many of the same values, and I hope that we can unite Wisconsinites to fight against right-wing special interests and make our state Supreme Court work for the people again.\nBut in the next three statements in which Dallet\u00a0talked about her values, she went further.\nDallet talked about not making it more difficult to vote, alluding to the debate over whether Wisconsin\u2019s photo ID law makes it more difficult to vote; she attacked the National Rifle Association, which is known for its activism to protect gun-owner rights; and she flatly stated that sales of a particular gun should be outlawed.\n4. I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug.\n5. That\u2019s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won\u2019t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money? nonramoney.org\/voter-pledge #NRABoycott\n6. Why do you need that rifle that was used in that (Parkland, Fla.) school shooting? What was it, an AR-15? Who ever needs to fire off that many rounds in a minute? There is no reason for that gun. There is no basis for it. It\u2019s not a gun that should be sold in the United States. I mean, let\u2019s talk about reasonable gun control \u2026. I\u2019m not going to write that law, that\u2019s going to be our legislatures. But we should all -- I mean, I\u2019m a citizen just like everyone else -- we should all write our legislatures, tell them how we think and let them write those laws.\nRecusal rule\nOn the remaining two statements, Lovejoy told us that when Dallet speaks about changing policy, \"she's referencing the need to update the Supreme Court recusal policy that currently allows sitting justices,\" such as retiring Justice Michael Gableman, \"to remain on cases where a party spent significantly on their behalf in their election.\"\nHere are those Dallet statements:\n7. It is the time for women. It\u2019s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights.\nThat statement was made during the concluding remarks of a campaign appearance. Dallet had begun her remarks talking about her experience as a prosecutor and judge, then she talked at length about the importance of the recusal rule, and then she spoke about the experience Screnock and Burns have, before concluding.\nIt could be argued that in making the \"policies we want\" statement, Dallet was echoing her remarks about recusals rather than making a general statement about the need \"get the policies we want.\"\nBut in the final statement, from a radio interview, it\u2019s harder to see the argument that Dallet was referring to recusals.\n8. All of the values that I talked about -- clean air and water, and equal protection, and women -- are under attack. \u00a0And, this is something we all feel and we all relate to. And I'm the candidate that is going to be able to protect those values at this critical time, and there is just too much at stake right now to have someone without the experience needed to advocate for the policies that need to be changed and to make sure to protect those values.\nDallet had been asked earlier in the interview about recusals. But she made the statement we cite when asked about about why she featured criticism of President Donald Trump in her first TV campaign ad.","cleaned_claim":"Rebecca Dallet has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives.","ambiguity_score":0.0977338776,"paraphrases":[["Rebecca Dallet has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that she believes need to be changed in order to achieve her political objectives.",0.0371282659],["Rebecca Dallet has discussed her desire to promote policies that she believes need to be changed in order to achieve her political goals.",0.0977338776],["Rebecca Dallet has spoken about her interest in pushing for policy changes that would help her achieve her political goals.",0.0278971419],["Rebecca Dallet has said that she is interested in working to change policies in order to achieve her political goals.",0.0227324087],["Rebecca Dallet has said that she is interested in advocating for policies that need to be changed in order to achieve her political objectives.",0.0130842505]]}

The allegations in this Facebook post range from the absurd\u2014comparing Ocasio-Cortez to an amphibian\u2014to the incendiary. But all of the claims, including the ones we didn\u2019t check, are misleading because they\u2019re presented as if they are uncontested facts, and that\u2019s not the case.\nThe burden of proof is high in claiming someone paid a minor for sex, and in the case of Menendez, that proof is missing.\nThe allegations against Ellison are murkier. We know that, while in law school, Ellison wrote an  article defending Louis Farrakhan against claims that Farrakhan was anti-semitic. Ellison then went on to renounce the Nation of Islam while also addressing those criticisms head-on in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. It seems clear that while this claim contains an element of truth, it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nAs to the claim that Ellison \"beats women,\" we know that Ellison has not been convicted of assault in a court of law. However, his former partner hasn\u2019t backed down from claims that he harmed her in what was clearly a volatile relationship. Without more evidence, it is hard to rule on this matter. Still, the claim does not come out of nowhere. While it contains an element of truth, this claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\nTogether, the charges in this post are problematic and, in the end, range from incindiary to largely unsubstantiated. We rate this viral Facebook post Mostly False.","full_article":"Democrats may have won a majority of seats in the U.S. House, but some bloggers don\u2019t think the party has much to brag about.\n\"Democrats just elected\u2026 a woman whose IQ is lower than a salamander, a man who preys on underage prostitutes, an anti-semitic, America-hater who married her brother, and an anti-semitic who beats women,\" reads a Facebook post that appeared online Nov. 7. \"Y\u2019all must be so proud.\"\nThe text flanks the pictures of four victors in Tuesday\u2019s election: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a representative- elect from New York; Bob Menendez, an incumbent senator from New Jersey; Ilhan Omar, a representative-elect from Minnesota; and Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota elected as the state\u2019s attorney general.\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has been shared nearly 17,000 times.\nWe feel that the allegation about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s IQ is hyperbole, and after looking into other claims about Omar\u2019s marital history, we don\u2019t have enough information to make a ruling, though the Associated Press has done a lot of reporting on the subject in response to the allegations.\nInstead, we\u2019ll check whether Menendez \"preys on underage prostitutes\" and if Ellison is \"an anti-semitic racist who beats women.\"\nMenendez\nFirst, let\u2019s look at Menendez. An Oct. 15 political ad from his Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, accuses Menendez of being a hypocrite.\n\"What about the underage prostitutes who accused you, according to the FBI?\" the narrator says. The charge is an old one from Menendez\u2019s last re-election campaign in 2012. It stems from an anonymous tip that Menendez and his friend, Salomon Melgen, hired underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.\nMenendez has denied the allegations and, the New York Times reported on Oct. 17, \"it has never been proven.\"\nThe FBI investigated the claims. \"The government took responsible steps to investigate these serious criminal allegations, which were not so \u2018easily disprovable,\u2019 as the defendants suggest,\" according to court documents.\nBut Washington Post reporter Salvador Rizzo, who traveled to the Dominican Republic in 2013 in part to investigate the underage-prostitution allegations, recalls that the FBI \"and a platoon of reporters from national and New Jersey news organizations spent months investigating whether the senator was committing sexual crimes with minors outside the country. The accusations were never substantiated.\"\nRizzo also talked to Melanie Sloan, a former Democratic congressional aide and a former federal prosecutor: \"I can tell you definitively that there was no evidence ever to support the underage-prostitution allegations,\" she said.\nIn a comprehensive fact-check of the Hugin\u2019s ad, Rizzo finds that \"to accuse a rival candidate of maybe sleeping with underage prostitutes, solid evidence is an absolute must. The evidence for Hugin\u2019s ad fails the test.\"\nThis Facebook post fails the test, too.\nEllison\nBut what about Ellison? An old tie to Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader with a history of making anti-semitic remarks, dogged the congressman during his campaign. As a law student at the University of Minnesota, Ellison wrote an article for the school newspaper that \"defended Farrakhan against accusations of anti-semitism,\" according to a Washington Post story from 2006. He renounced the Nation of Islam that year, when he first ran for Congress. In 2016, a spokesperson for Ellison told CNN that he \"rejects all forms of anti-semitism.\"\nThe congressman also wrote an opinion piece for the Post declaring that he \"neglected to scrutinize the words\" of Farrakhan, \"who mixed a message of African American empowerment with scapegoating of other communities.\"\n\"These men organize by sowing hatred and division, including anti-semitism, homophobia and a chauvinistic model of manhood,\" Ellison wrote. \"I disavowed them long ago, condemned their views and apologized.\"\nOthers maintain that Ellison made anti-semitic statements himself. In a 2017 opinion piece for The Hill, Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard University, wrote: \"A prominent lawyer, with significant credibility, told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her, because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school.\"\nEllison has denied that he\u2019s anti-semitic. He\u2019s also denied more recent allegations that he abused his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan. She\u2019s accused the congressman of physical and emotional abuse. Once, she said, he shouted profanities at her while trying to drag her off the bed, the New York Times reported in August.\nMinnesota\u2019s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party hired a law firm to investigate and \"found the allegations unsubstantiated,\" according to Politico.","cleaned_claim":"Democrats just elected include\u2026 a man who preys on underage prostitutes \u2026 and an anti-semitic racist who beats women.","ambiguity_score":0.3281285763,"paraphrases":[["Democrats have just elected a man who sexually exploits underage prostitutes, and an anti-semitic racist who beats women.",0.2887189984],["The Democrats have just elected a man who preys on underage prostitutes and an anti-semitic racist who beats women.",0.1286642998],["Democrats just elected a man who preys on underage prostitutes and an anti-semitic racist who beats women.",0.0604347475],["The Democrats have just elected a man who sexually exploits underage prostitutes and an anti-semitic racist who beats women.",0.3281285763]]}

And then I came along. Now we\u2019re winning a lot of cases because they know that they\u2019re not on very solid ground.\"\nThis statement contains multiple problems. For decades, the United States, like essentially all countries, has tended to lose most WTO cases in which it was a defendant. But it has won most cases when it was the complaining party.\nUnder Trump, there are some indications of an improved (though still losing) U.S. record in cases it\u2019s defending against. But trade experts say this has had little to do with Trump\u2019s policies, which have in fact put the WTO\u2019s continued operations at risk.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.","full_article":"During a visit to a new Shell plant outside Pittsburgh, President Donald Trump attacked the World Trade Organization, the international entity that decides trade disputes.\n\"We were losing all our cases until I came along,\" Trump said in Monaca, Pa. \"We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. Almost every case, ... lost, lost, lost. They thought we were stupid. They were the ones ruling. And then I came along. Now we\u2019re winning a lot of cases because they know that they\u2019re not on very solid ground.\"\nIs that accurate?\nWe found that certain aspects of the U.S. record at the WTO are slightly better. But overall, we found no dramatic turnaround.\nAbout the WTO\nMore than 160 nations have joined the World Trade Organization, an institution that serves as a forum for resolving international trade disputes.\nBefore proceeding to litigation, countries can work out their differences through a \"conciliation and mediation\" process. Trade experts told PolitiFact that roughly 60% of claims are settled this way, without the WTO rendering a \"winner\" or \"loser\" at all.\nIn the roughly 40% of cases that remain unresolved, the dispute goes to a WTO-approved panel of three, none of whom are from a country involved in the dispute.\nSo, for starters, Trump ignored that most WTO cases don\u2019t produce a winner or loser. Kent Jones, an economist at Babson College, called the conciliation system a benefit of the WTO because it encourages the disputing parties to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution of the case.\nAnother point that Trump glossed over is that \"countries typically do not bring WTO dispute cases unless they are confident that they will win,\" Jones said.\nThis produces a longstanding and distinct pattern of wins and losses: The complaining country usually wins. And that cuts both ways for supporting Trump\u2019s assertion.\nDan Ikenson of the pro-free-trade Cato Institute looked at the U.S. record in WTO trade disputes between 1995 and 2017. He found that when the United States was defending against a complaint, it lost 89% of the time.\nThat would seem to support at least part of Trump\u2019s assertion \u2014 but it leaves out the other side of the coin.\nIn cases where the United States was the complaining party, Ikerson found a 91% U.S. victory rate. (Also worth noting: The United States was the most active complaining party.)\nThe U.S. record \u2014 strong as a complainant, weak as a defendant \u2014 is mirrored by the records of most other countries, trade specialists said.\nTrade experts said they were unaware of comprehensive studies that went past March 2017. But Elena V. McLean, a political scientist at the University at Buffalo-State University of New York, did a \"very quick estimate\" of recent cases for PolitiFact and found a slightly improved record for the United States.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, she said, the United States brought two cases as a complainant and won both, which is in line with past results. In seven cases brought against the United States, the United States won three, or 43%. That\u2019s a bit better than the U.S. long-term performance, though it\u2019s still a losing record.\nWe did not hear back from the White House and the U.S. Trade Representative when we asked for any additional supporting data for Trump\u2019s assertion.\nTrump\u2019s impact on the WTO\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Trump\u2019s positions changed the WTO\u2019s ruling patterns, trade experts agreed.\nWTO cases often take years to reach a final decision, so some of the decisions McLean tallied were inherited from the period before Trump came to office, she said.\nThe United States did win one notable, if \"arcane,\" case during Trump\u2019s tenure that broke with a pattern of previous losses on the same issue, said Stuart S. Malawer, a professor of law and international trade at George Mason University\u2019s Schar School of Policy and Government. The case involves Canada and concerned the methodology of determining the price of imports in dumping cases, he said.\nHowever, Malawer said that there was no indication that a change of policy by Trump had anything to do it. The decision \"seems to be based principally on the technical aspects of the issue,\" he said.\nExperts said it was ironic that Trump was trumpeting his victories at the WTO when his administration has blocked new judges for appointment to the WTO\u2019s appellate body.\n\"In a matter of months, this U.S. action will deplete the roster of judges and deprive the WTO of a working dispute settlement system,\" Jones said.\nIf that happens, McLean said, \"the politics of trade will become much less cooperative, and escalation to all-out trade wars will become much more likely. And the overall effect of trade wars on economies, global and domestic, is not something that can be described as \u2018winning,\u2019 no matter how you slice it.\"","cleaned_claim":"We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. ...

In 2014, drug overdose deaths totaled 1,705, or 1,700 if using statistics from IDPH, which tend to be more accurate.\nAs for the other figures, the percent increase from 2010 is slightly more than 32 percent, and drug overdose deaths in 2014 that were associated with heroin is about 42 percent. But as IDPH notes, tracking overdose deaths involving heroin cannot be reliably determined as counties\u2019 coroners did not specifically test for heroin prior to 2013.\nWe don\u2019t see these discrepancies as an attempt to mislead in making his case for heroin and prescription opioid addiction treatment legislation he is advocating. If anything, it underscores the growing epidemic that\u2019s not only gripping Illinois, but the rest of the country.\nWe rate Durbin\u2019s claim True.","full_article":"U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has been one of the most vocal members in Congress in the fight against the growing heroin and opioid epidemic in Illinois and across the country.\nDurbin has introduced a handful of measures to expand and improve access to treatment programs for heroin addiction, as well as legislation that would curtail the amount of prescription opioid medication on the market.\nIn a July 20 press release discussing new initiatives to combat heroin and prescription opioid addiction, Durbin highlighted some startling statistics to hammer home just how big a problem opioid abuse has become in Illinois:\n\"Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin. Illinois is ranked number one in the nation for a decline in treatment capacity between 2007 and 2012, and is now ranked the third worst in the country for state-funded treatment capacity.\"\nThose are some pretty shocking numbers and there are a lot of them, so we wanted to take a closer look.\nDrug overdose deaths in Illinois\nDurbin\u2019s press secretary John Normoyle said in an email the senator was using overdose statistics provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that the figures cited came from a provisional report for 2014 and the number of drug overdose deaths were not revised to reflect the most recent count.\nData on drug overdose deaths is readily available on the CDC website, which shows there were a total of 1,705 drug overdose deaths in 2014, compared to 1,288 in 2010 -- a 32.4 percent increase over that four-year period.\nHowever, the Illinois Department of Public Health, which reports preliminary and final drug overdose deaths to the CDC, puts the 2010 total at 1,284 and 1,700 in 2014 -- a slight discrepancy but not unusual when reporting overdose deaths as they often get revised.\nFor that reason, Divya Little, a public information officer at IDPH, said the state\u2019s finalized data is more accurate, though the difference is negligible with regard to some of the other statistics presented in Durbin\u2019s claim.\nOf the roughly 1,700 drug overdose deaths, 711 were heroin-related, accounting for nearly 42 percent of all drug overdose deaths in 2014.\nWhile the percentage of drug overdose deaths associated with heroin would be a little more than 1 percentage point higher using the provisional 1,652 figure, Normoyle said the 40 percent statistic was pulled from a Reboot Illinois article that uses final data for 2014.\nIt\u2019s important to note that prior to 2013, counties did not specifically test for heroin in overdose deaths, so tracking deaths involving heroin cannot be reliably determined, according to IDPH.\nDurbin\u2019s use of outdated numbers from the CDC neither misleads nor drastically alters the claim. If anything, it helps Durbin in making his point that heroin and prescription opioid abuse and addiction continues to get worse.\nDwindling state-funded treatment capacity\nA report published in August 2015 by the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy at Roosevelt University, or ICDP, shows state-funded treatment capacity in Illinois fell by 52 percent from 2007-2012, the largest decrease in the nation.\nDurbin, who used statistics from this study, is correct when he says Illinois led the nation in the decline for state-funded treatment capacity. In 2007, Illinois ranked 28th in state-funded treatment capacity before dropping to No. 44, or third worst in 2012, behind Tennessee and Texas, respectively, according to the report.\nKathie Kane-Willis, co-founder and director of the ICDP, told Politifact Illinois the state\u2019s budget woes are making the situation much worse, and Illinois already was in \"pretty dire straits\" long before the political tug-of-war between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democratic-controlled Legislature ensued.\nIllinois hasn\u2019t had an actual budget for more than a year and the majority of the state\u2019s social service providers that offer drug treatment programs haven\u2019t been funded or received payment since July 1, 2015, leading many to cut programs, turn away people seeking help or shut down entirely.\nAlthough a six-month stopgap budget was passed on June 30 that appropriates $667 million for human services, including nonprofits and other social service providers, that only amounts to 65 percent of the cost of those services since last July.\n\"When you look at Illinois, we have a crumbling treatment infrastructure,\" Kane-Willis said. \"We do not have the capacity to treat the people who need it.\"\nKane-Willis, a former heroin user, said that in light of these fiscal issues, Illinois probably\u00a0now is second-worst in the U.S. when it comes to treatment capacity as Tennessee has improved and expanded treatment programs and capacity since the study was released.\nTreating those in need\nDurbin notes that as the state's treatment capacity shrinks, the vast majority of Illinoisans who are in need of treatment do not\u00a0receive it.\nA report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, \"Behavioral Health Barometer: Illinois, 2014,\" found \"individuals aged 12 or older with illicit drug dependence or abuse, about 32,000 individuals (12.7 percent ) per year in 2009\u20132013 received treatment for their illicit drug use within the year prior to being surveyed.\"","cleaned_claim":"Illinois suffered 1,652 overdose deaths in 2014 ... of which 40 percent were associated with heroin.

So he goes to these oligarchs and borrows money.\"\nWeiner called it \"informed speculation.\" But at PolitiFact, we operate on the principle that the person making the claim is responsible for providing evidence. In this case the evidence is lacking, in part because Trump has revealed so little. Even his net worth remains a mystery.\nNonetheless, records show that banks are still loaning money to him, albeit not the big U.S. institutions. There's no evidence to prove that it's because the large banks have shut him out.\nSimilarly, there's little evidence to show that Trump has been seeking loans from oligarchs instead of financial institutions. There's circumstantial evidence that oligarchs have been involved in his business dealings, but mostly through intermediary companies that own a financial stake in his projects. That's different from a direct loan.\nBecause the statement seems to contain some elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/749a7984-1f65-451f-996f-cfb469302219","full_article":"Donald Trump's relationship with Russia has become an issue because of several factors: his campaign's ties in the region; the claim that the leaks of Democratic National Committee email originated from Russian hackers; Trump's conflicting claims about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin;\u00a0and Trump's invitation to the Russians to hack Hillary's Clinton's emails.\nFormer Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner\u00a0discussed Trump's Russian ties on the July 27, 2016, edition of Real Time with Bill Maher.\u00a0(Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a Clinton top adviser. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal.)\n\"The reason he loves Putin, we know this now. The banks no longer loan him money because he's a terrible risk. So he goes to these (Russian) oligarchs and borrows money. He knows the end game is coming for him. He's thinking about who he wants to ingratiate himself (with). We have a presidential candidate who is literally kind of approaching Russia on his knees because he needs them to loan him money.\"\nBanks are no longer loaning Trump money, and Trump is trying to get it from Russian oligarchs?\nWhen we contacted Weiner, he\u00a0characterized his comment as \"informed speculation among real estate builders and bankers. There is some transparency on lending for buildings. But since he hasn\u2019t really built anything since the Soho Grand, there isn\u2019t much to look at. The part about him being a terrible risk is borne out by his record of not paying debts.\"\nSo we went looking for some evidence on the question of who is lending Trump money.\nHard evidence is lacking because Trump runs a private business, so most of his records are not available to the public. In addition, he has repeatedly refused to release any recent tax returns, which could be another indication of his source of capital.\nWe sought out what's available.\nNo loans for Trump?\nThe Wall Street Journal reported in March 2016 that the candidate's available financial statements show that the struggling German bank Deutsche Bank \"is the only bank with a big Wall Street presence that continues to lend to him.\" Other large institutions do little if any business with Trump, the newspaper reported, but smaller institutions do.\nThe Journal said \"many big banks have shunned him,\" but the paper also reported that Trump has few loans with big banks.\u00a0\"Bankers say that's partly because Mr. Trump has moved away from developing multimillion-dollar real-estate projects to managing them and licensing the Trump name, reducing his need to borrow.\"\nDaughter Ivanka told the Journal that the big banks are not wary of investing with Trump: \u00a0\"The biggest banking institutions are constantly soliciting us. But we don't need a lot of financing because we have a great balance sheet and a tremendous amount of cash.\" In addition, she said, Trump has moved to private banks that have lower interest rates.\nNonetheless, various media outlets have stated, without offering any documentation, that Trump can't get funds from most banks.\nFrom Slate: \"After his 2004 bankruptcy and his long streak of lawsuits, the big banks decided he wasn\u2019t worth the effort. They\u2019d rather not touch the self-proclaimed 'king of debt.' \"\nFrom Talking Points Memo: \"Trump has been blackballed by all major US banks.\"\nFor his part, Weiner pointed us to an Aug. 2 commentary posted on Time.com, which\u00a0reported that \"the real truth is that, as major banks in America stopped lending him money following his many bankruptcies, the Trump organization was forced to seek financing from non-traditional institutions. Several had direct ties to Russian financial interests in ways that have raised eyebrows.\"\nWhich leads us to the Russian part of Weiner's claim.\nLoans from oligarchs?\nWeiner also sent us a Politico article explaining how Trump has tried to get Russians as tenants and buyers for his various properties, including a 17-bedroom mansion in Palm Beach,\u00a0which he bought in bankruptcy for $41 million in 2004. He eventually sold the property to a Russian oligarch for $95 million in 2008. But that was a property sale. Weiner was talking about getting loans from oligarchs, a very different thing.\nOther media outlets have reported that Trump has actively marketed condo projects to Russians, particularly Russians with money to burn \u2014 or hide. Politico reported that when it came to the Palm Beach property Trump sold to oligarch billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, Rybolovlev has probably never been in the house. He subsequently denied owning it and preparations are underway to tear it down.\nThis may explain why, at a real estate conference in 2008, Donald Trump Jr., the candidate's son, said that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\nBut the issue for this fact-check is borrowing money, and we couldn't find any evidence that Trump has been getting loans from any oligarchs. The few cases we found involved Trump partnering with people with ties to the region.\nTrump has been looking for business opportunities in the Soviet Union since at least 1987, when he flew there to try to develop luxury hotels in Moscow and Leningrad. None of the real estate deals ever led to a groundbreaking.\nRussian involvement in financing deals seems to be coming indirectly.\nThe best-known example is a company that Trump partnered with for hotel-condominium projects \u2014 one in Toronto, the other in Lower Manhattan known as Trump SoHo.\nThe company that partnered with Trump is the Bayrock Group, chaired by former Soviet official Tevfik Arif, who hails from Kazakhstan. Bayrock has drawn attention for a host of reasons.\nFirst, one of its prominent associates is Felix Satter (later changed to Sater), a Russian immigrant with an office in Trump Tower in New York. Satter served time beginning in 1993 for slashing a man's face in a barroom brawl and, in a lawsuit, was accused of threatening to electrocute the testicles of a Trump investor, according to Slate. In addition, Satter was \"implicated in a huge stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals,\" according to the New York Times. He later became an FBI\u00a0informant.\nSecond, when the company's finance director, Jody Kriss, sued Bayrock for fraud, Kriss alleged that the company, founded in 1989 in Moscow, was \"backed by oligarchs and money they stole from the Russian people.\"\nAccording to that lawsuit, \"Month after month for two years, ... whenever Bayrock ran out of cash, Bayrock Holdings would magically show up with a wire from \u2018somewhere\u2019 just large enough to keep the company going.\"\nAlso feeding into the pot of Bayrock money was a fund called the FL Group. Kriss' lawsuit says it attracted Russian investors \"in favor with Putin.\" It chipped in $50 million in 2007, which became controversial after the $50 million partnership deal was re-classified as a loan, a move of questionable legality because it seemed to be designed to avoid U.S. taxes, according to the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph.\nThis may seem far removed from Trump, but the Telegraph reported that Trump signed off on that deal. According to the paper, Alan Garten, Trump\u2019s lawyer, claimed that the billionaire had simply signed letters acknowledging the deal as a \"limited partner\" with Bayrock.\nThe Kriss suit, while claiming that \"tax evasion and money-laundering are the core of Bayrock\u2019s business model,\" also says, \"There is no evidence (Donald) Trump took any part in, or knew of, their racketeering. Any contrary inference would be unjust.\"\n(Editor\u2019s note, Aug. 16, 2016: After we published our fact-check, we received a response from a representative for Bayrock, which said, \"The allegations made by Jody Kriss are baseless and unsubstantiated.\")\nThe Trump campaign declined to comment when we inquired about Weiner's statement.","cleaned_claim":"We know this now.

We need a $15 minimum wage so that no one is paid a poverty wage. #RaiseTheWage\"\nThe tweet features a video of Omar at a Feb. 7\u00a0congressional hearing in which she said, \"The median pay for a McDonald\u2019s worker was $7,000 in 2017.\u00a0That is the pay gap between the CEO that\u2019s making $21.8 (million) to the $7,000 that a worker who has put in 40 hours a day gets paid.\"\nIf you\u2019ve heard of Omar before, it\u2019s because she was in the news recently apologizing for comments about campaign contributions and Israel, after her fellow Democrats said the comments were anti-Semitic.\nMost of Omar\u2019s public comments since\u00a0her 2018 election have focused on families and wages.\nOmar\u2019s staff told us the McDonald\u2019s numbers come from the company itself. (She meant to say 40 hours \"a week\" and not \"a day\" during her remarks.)\u00a0As part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms, publicly traded companies have to report how much compensation the CEO got and how much the median worker got.\nIn McDonald\u2019s SEC filing, it said CEO Steve Easterbrook made $21.8 million in 2017. The amount was largely driven by stock price and other company performance incentives.\nThe company also said its median worker made $7,017, as Omar said. But there are two important qualifications: That was for all McDonald\u2019s workers across the globe. And it included \"all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers.\" The company\u2019s filing gave the example of a part-time restaurant crew worker in Poland who made the median amount.\nOmar\u2019s statement was about raising the U.S. hourly wage to $15.\nMcDonald\u2019s worldwide median pay doesn\u2019t say anything about pay in the United States, with its very different labor market and all the things that affect those markets, such as health insurance, labor laws and more.\nEstimating the real number\nIf $7,000 a year isn\u2019t the right number for a median American McDonald\u2019s worker, what is?\nMcDonald\u2019s couldn\u2019t provide the answer, although the press office told us that the average pay of hourly workers is over $10 an hour, for corporate-owned establishments. That represents about one out of nine McDonald\u2019s, because most are franchise-owned.\nThe economics firm Indeed posts McDonald\u2019s pay on its website. The average crew member, like the one in Poland, makes $9.21 an hour in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the median pay for a someone doing that work in the fast-food industry is $9.70 an hour.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hours worked per week at a limited-service restaurant is 24.2 hours.\nScale that up to a full year and, using the slightly higher rate from the BLS, the typical crew worker makes about $12,200.\nWe invited McDonald\u2019s to respond to our calculation and the press office said the company had no further information to share.\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented think tank, compares the pay of CEOs to typical workers. The institute estimated that in the United States, the typical CEO makes 312 times more than the average worker. Based on our analysis, the ratio at McDonald\u2019s is about 1,786 to one.","cleaned_claim":"In 2017, the CEO of McDonalds got paid $21.8 million.

As for abortions being paid for with tax dollars, this is a vast oversimplification of rules surrounding Medicaid, which provides health care for poor women.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/9c664b20-be6e-46f5-93f4-bb96a98299e7","full_article":"The anti-abortion group Ohio Right to Life circulated a stinging release about Democratic senate candidate (and former Ohio governor) Ted Strickland recently.\n\"Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars,\" the Aug. 2 press release reads.\nSpokeswoman Katherine Franklin of Ohio Right to Life told PolitiFact Ohio that the 2016 Democratic platform inspired their media message.\nOn reproductive rights, the platform reads, \"We will continue to oppose\u2014and seek to overturn\u2014federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman\u2019s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment.\"\nClinton\u2019s chosen running mate, Tim Kaine, recently faced scrutiny on the subject of the Hyde amendment, which has barred federal funding for most abortions since being signed into law in 1976. In a weekend interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, Kaine said that he is personally in favor of the Hyde restrictions, but would support Clinton and the party\u2019s platform to repeal it, as vice president.\nBecause Kaine was somewhat compromised on the issue, Franklin said, Ohio Right to Life wanted to tease out Strickland\u2019s stance on the Hyde amendment. Ohio Right to Life has endorsed Strickland\u2019s opponent, incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman.\nStrickland, on Hyde\nCongress passed the Hyde amendment three years after U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade, which upholds a woman\u2019s right to abortion. Its sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, a Republican from Illinois, said during a congressional debate, \"I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody from having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the (Medicaid) bill.\"\nBy prohibiting federal funding of abortion, the Hyde restrictions primarily affect low-income women on Medicaid.\nHyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, it doesn\u2019t have to be \"repealed\" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level.\nWhen asked his position on the Hyde amendment, Strickland\u2019s spokeswoman Liz Margolis told the Columbus Dispatch, that he favors getting rid of the Hyde restrictions. \u00a0\"Ted stands with the people of Ohio who believe that women have the right to make their own healthcare decisions, and that includes all women regardless of income,\" Margolis said.\nAs a congressman in 2003, NARAL Pro-Choice America rated his voting record as in line with \"pro-life\" legislators.\nOn his website, Strickland says he believes that \"a woman\u2019s healthcare choices are between a woman and her doctor,\" which is an indication that he favors abortion rights.\nBut does he agree with abortions \"up until the moment of birth?\"\nDue-date abortions?\nPolitiFact has heard this claim before, directed at Clinton. In a New Hampshire debate in February, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said that Clinton \"believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child.\"\nWe rated this claim False, because abortions at the nine-month mark just don\u2019t happen. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told PolitiFact, \"If the mother\u2019s life was at risk, the treatment for that is delivery, and the baby survives.\"\nTwenty-three states prohibit abortions after \"viability,\" the point at which the fetus can survive outside the womb, or at about 23 weeks.The reproductive health nonprofit Guttmacher Institute reports that just 5 percent of abortions occur after 16 weeks, and 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks.\nA 2015 documentary followed the practices of the four remaining doctors in the country who will perform a third-trimester abortion.\nOn-demand?\nSeven states and the District of Columbia have not passed time-frame restrictions on abortions. Franklin, of Ohio Right to Life, uses these as examples of places where a woman could have an \"on-demand abortion.\" But it rarely happens that way, in practice.\nEven prior to viability, on-demand abortions are impossible in most of the country. Twenty-eight states have legislated waiting periods for an abortion procedure, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion.\nNew Hampshire, Oregon and Vermont have the fewest abortion restrictions. But \"on demand\" is still a stretch, even in these states. In New Hampshire and Oregon, almost 80 percent of counties have no abortion clinic. In Vermont, there is no abortion provider in 50 percent of the counties.\nTaxpayer-funded abortions?\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation determined that 13 percent of women of reproductive age are on Medicaid, compared with the 65 percent that had private insurance, as of 2014.\nMost states have created laws similar to the Hyde amendment and do not fund abortions for low-income women on Medicaid, but fifteen states have mechanisms to use state funds to cover abortions for Medicaid recipients.\nBy the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s count, 2.7 million women live in a state where coverage of abortion services under Medicaid, ACA Marketplace plans and\/or private policies is limited to cases of rape, incest, and where the mother\u2019s life is in danger.\nWere the Hyde amendment to be nixed, the number of abortions among Medicaid-eligible women would be expected to increase by approximately 33,000, or an increase of 2.5 percent, according to the Guttmacher institute.","cleaned_claim":"Ted Strickland stands in lockstep with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their desire to force Americans to pay for abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, with their taxpayer dollars.","ambiguity_score":0.0387984477,"paraphrases":[["Ted Strickland is in complete agreement with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby on their stance that Americans should be required to finance abortions with their tax money, all the way up until the moment of birth.",0.0359715484],["Ted Strickland agrees with Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion lobby that Americans should be forced to pay for abortions through their taxes, up until the moment of birth.",0.0301647484],["Ted Strickland is in complete agreement with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby on their stance of making Americans pay for abortions with their tax dollars, all the way up until the moment of birth.",0.0387984477],["Ted Strickland agrees with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby that Americans should have to pay for abortions with their taxpayer dollars.",0.0352461673],["Ted Strickland is aligned with Hillary Clinton and the abortion lobby in their support for using taxpayer money to fund abortions with no restrictions.",0.021662632]]}

Clinton responded that Trump is \"ridiculous.\"\n\"In 2009, (the foundation) took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization, voluntarily disclosing donors, significantly reducing sources of funding, even to the point of, you know, of those funding being involved in providing medication to treat HIV\/AIDS,\" Clinton said.\nClinton\u2019s family, campaign and supporters have used similar defenses lately, often calling the Clinton Foundation\u2019s disclosure agreements \"unprecedented\" and pointing out that charities associated with the Bush presidents didn\u2019t have to abide by the same standards.\nJust how accurate is this talking point?\nClinton is right that the foundation bearing her family name has done more than what is required of charities by law. But the requirements are rather basic to begin with, and other nonprofits, including those tied to presidential candidates and presidents, have been similarly forthcoming.\nClearing a low bar\nThe Clinton Foundation, as part of an ethics agreement with the Obama administration, promised to publish the names of all of its donors, roll back Bill Clinton\u2019s involvement in fundraising, and stop accepting donations to the Clinton Global Initiative from foreign governments, among other pledges.\nThe foundation only began to do that in 2008, as a condition of Clinton\u2019s confirmation as secretary of state in order to preempt conflicts of interest (and it hasn\u2019t always lived up to that ethics agreement). Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, pointed out that the Clinton Foundation\u00a0continued disclosing donors after Clinton left office even though\u00a0it was \"under no obligation to do so.\"\nNone of what the foundation agreed to do \u2014 disclosing donor identities, limiting an official\u2019s role, or not taking foreign donations \u2014 is required by tax law.\nThe law doesn\u2019t actually require much from nonprofits like the foundation.\n\"The legal requirements are so absolutely minimal that it\u2019s like saying, \u2018No, I haven\u2019t shot anyone today, so you should be grateful,\u2019 \" said Daniel Schuman, policy director for Demand Progress, a progressive advocacy group focused on civil liberties and government transparency.\nSuzanne Friday, legal counsel to the nonpartisan Council on Foundations, agreed that the laws are \"basic.\" Many nonprofits are volunteering a lot more information than what\u2019s required, she said.\n\"Anyone who is more putting more information on their website or wherever goes above and beyond the law,\" Friday said.\nTax-exempt organizations or 501(c)(3) groups only have to reveal a few bits of information to the public when requested. The requestable tax documents can include the last three years of a group\u2019s Form 990, which gives an overview of the organization\u2019s activities, leadership and finances.\nMore specific requirements vary by state and also depend on whether an organization is a private foundation or public charity. Confusingly, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity, not a private foundation, even though it has the word \"foundation\" in its name.\nPrivate foundations (for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) are typically controlled by one person, one family or one corporation and have just a few funding sources. In addition to Form 990, they have to disclose their donors upon request of the public. (This is how we know, for example, that World Wrestling Entertainment gave $1 million to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 2009.)\nThe requirements are less stringent for public charities, which includes schools and churches but also organizations with many funding sources \u2014 like the Clinton Foundation. They don\u2019t have to disclose their donors, even if requested, but they do have to prove to the IRS that a third of their revenue comes from fundraising.\nSo the Clinton Foundation is not required by law to disclose its donors, as it does on its contributors page, and most other nonprofits don\u2019t give this information, said David Callahan, editor-in-chief of Inside Philanthropy. (Friday of the Council on Foundations said this is to protect donor privacy.)\u00a0Minassian referred us to the Clinton Foundation's\u00a0Charity Navigator rating\u00a0of four stars out of four stars and a 93 out of 100 in accountability and transparency.\nThe Clinton Foundation, however, is not the only charity disclosing its donors on a website. The Wikimedia Foundation, the Sunlight Foundation, the Center for Global Development and the Center for Strategic and International Studies are are all examples of public nonprofits that voluntarily disclose donors.\nMany nonprofits like Oxfam and the World Resources Institute publish annual reports that include more comprehensive donor rolls on their websites, said Friday. The Clinton Foundation does not do this.\n\u2018The wild west\u2019 of presidential foundations\nThere are about 1.1 million public charities like the Clinton Foundation, but only a handful are linked to presidents and presidential candidates.\nExperts told us the Clinton Foundation is among the most transparent in this group of charities, which, for the most part, are foundations associated with presidential libraries. (The Clinton Foundation\u00a0was initially\u00a0focused on\u00a0Bill Clinton\u2019s library and evolved into the organization it is today.)\nAnthony Clark, author of a book on presidential libraries called The Last Campaign, told us the presidential library foundations follow basic disclosure laws and therefore are notoriously opaque. He agreed with that the Clinton Foundation\u2019s transparency was \"unprecedented.\"\n\"It\u2019s the wild west,\" he said. \"Before 2008, the closest we came to learning the donors was a donor wall with major donors engraved in granite or a bronze plaque.\"\nHere are two charts detailing the disclosure and finances of charities related to presidential candidates and presidents:\nAs the chart shows, the Clinton Foundation discloses more information than the other presidential foundations. It also fundraises significantly more. For that and a few more reasons \u2014 such as the fact that Clinton has served as secretary of state and is running for president \u2014 experts told us, it belongs in a category of its own.\n\"The sheer scope and size of the Clinton Foundation is also unprecedented and warrants extra measures to guard against conflicts of interest,\" said Craig Holman of the government accountability group Public Citizen.\nSchuman of Demand Progress also brought up Marc Rich, a former fugitive and Clinton Foundation donor pardoned by Bill Clinton on his last day in office, as a conflict of interest issue that preceded the \"above and beyond\" disclosure steps.\nHillary Clinton \"doesn\u2019t seem to be meeting her own standards either,\" said Schuman, referring to unsuccessful legislation she cosponsored in the Senate on disclosing gifts to presidential foundations in 2001.\nThe Clinton campaign specifically forwarded us reports about George W. Bush's continued involvement in his father\u2019s foundation while he was president. We also found reports of Bush foundations taking foreign donations during that time.\nExperts agreed that more scrutiny should have been placed on the Bush family, but the situations are somewhat different.\n\"Adult children aren\u2019t tied financially and otherwise to their parents the way one\u2019s spouse is tied to another spouse, \"said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University in St. Louis law professor who specializes in government ethics. \" \u2018Hey, they did it too\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s not quite as juvenile as that, but it\u2019s not a particularly persuasive argument.\"\n\"The Bush foundations did not raise comparable amounts of money and from as many foreign sources as the Clinton Foundation,\" said Holman of Public Citizen.\nIn contrast to the Bush organizations, three other public nonprofits tied to presidents and presidential hopefuls have been rather\u00a0forthcoming,\u00a0though they don't disclose all their donors as the Clinton Foundation does.\nThis election cycle, former presidential candidate Jeb Bush disclosed the vast majority of donors to his Foundation for Excellence in Education early in his campaign, and the foundation subsequently published their names on its website. Bush, who started the think tank in 2008 after his tenure as Florida governor, also stepped down as its chairman when he began to seriously consider running for president in early 2015.\nJimmy Carter\u2019s nonprofit is perhaps the most similar to the Clinton Foundation with its focus on international work in human rights, poverty and disease. (Most other presidential foundations function as political think tanks advancing the ideology of its president or as education shops promoting and preserving his legacy, Clark said.)\nThe Carter Center has been disclosing its donors every year in annual reports since 1982, when it was founded.\u00a0It does, however, take anonymous donations.\nAnd then there\u2019s Barack Obama, whose presidential library foundation also lists its contributors\u00a0who've donated more than $200\u00a0and publishes its financial documents. Plus,\u00a0Schuman added, \"He did it without being under duress.\"","cleaned_claim":"The Clinton Foundation took steps that went above and beyond all legal requirements and, indeed, all standard requirements followed by every other charitable organization.","ambiguity_score":0.2328066975,"paraphrases":[["The Clinton Foundation went above and beyond legal and standard requirements for charitable organizations.",0.0121803088],["The Clinton Foundation took extra steps to make sure they were meeting all legal requirements and going above and beyond what other charitable organizations do.",0.022987131],["The Clinton Foundation took extra steps to make sure they were following all legal requirements and going above and beyond what other charitable organizations do.",0.0212053135],["The Clinton Foundation went above and beyond what is legally required of charitable organizations, setting a higher standard for other such organizations to follow.",0.2328066975]]}

The previous day, it reported 13 new cases, up from seven new cases on Aug. 15.\nOn Aug. 18, following Trump\u2019s comment, New Zealand reported another 13 new cases.\nThe new cases in recent days have caused alarm in New Zealand, where strict lockdown policies and travel restrictions aim to put a lid on the virus. The leadership has responded by postponing the country\u2019s election and locking down Auckland, its largest city.\nAndrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, said it\u2019s a stretch for Trump to say New Zealand had ever \"beat\" the virus, since the pandemic was raging elsewhere and New Zealand has needed mitigation efforts to keep cases low.\nBut New Zealand\u2019s new cases are a far cry from the outbreak in the U.S., which has reported more than 50,000 new cases per day for most of August and July, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day average of new cases in the U.S. was 50,927 on Aug. 17.\n\"That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard in quite a while,\" Brooke Nichols, an assistant professor of global health at Boston University, said of Trump\u2019s claim comparing the two nations.\nAs of Aug. 18, New Zealand\u2019s health ministry had recorded 1,643 confirmed and probable cases in total, along with 22 deaths. There are currently 90 active cases in the country.\nThe U.S. leads the world in cumulative cases and deaths, by contrast.\u00a0It has seen nearly 5.5 million cases and more than 171,000 deaths as of Aug. 18. That\u2019s a quarter of the world\u2019s known cases in a country that, with around 330 million people, represents about 4% of the global population.\nThe disparity is wide even when you adjust for the size of both countries.

Charlie Crist\u2019s past positions as a Republican lawmaker are being brought back to light as Crist seeks to return to elected office as a Democrat.\nCrist is challenging incumbent Rep. David Jolly, R-Belleair Bluffs, for Florida\u2019s 13th Congressional District, which includes Pinellas County at the western edge of Florida\u2019s pivotal I-4 corridor.\nAt a televised debate in St. Petersburg Sept. 19, 2016, moderators from the Tampa Bay Times and 10 News WTSP allowed the candidates to ask the other a question. Crist declined, saying he\u2019d rather save the time for a question from a college student. Jolly used the time to bring up Crist\u2019s proposal to restore chain gangs to Florida while Crist served as a Republican in the state Senate in the 1990s.\nJolly painted a vivid picture of Crist traveling to Alabama in 1995 with Florida\u2019s first African-American corrections secretary to inspect a chain gang in operation.\n\"You stood there, over three African-American prisoners in, chains, on their knees on the side of the road. Saying that it was a great sight,\" Jolly said to Crist.\nJolly closed by asking, \"Did you ever hesitate, or did you just see political opportunity in that moment to be a Republican tough on crime?\"\nCrist said \"it was beneath\" Jolly to suggest it had something to do with race, and the state needed to be tough given how bad violent crime was in Florida at the time.\n\"In the mid 1990s, in our state, we were No. 1 in violent crime in America,\" \u00a0Crist said.\n\"The only concern I had was for the citizens of Florida, who were subjected to a violent crime every three minutes and 45 seconds,\" Crist added.\nIn a separate fact-check, we examined Jolly\u2019s story about Crist\u2019s visit to Alabama. Here, we are looking at Crist\u2019s rebuttal.\nWhen it comes to the facts, Crist is correct on both statistics.\nCrist\u2019s\u00a0campaign directed us to data from the Disaster Center, which used FBI Uniform Crime Reports to compare violent crime across states.\nThe data shows from 1991 to 1997, Florida was ranked No. 1 for the rate of violent crimes for every 100,000 people.\nTo calculate the rate of violent crime, you take the total number for each of the violent crime categories (murder, rape, robbery and assault) for every 100,000 population in that year.\nIn 1998, Florida was ranked No. 2., with New Mexico earning the top spot.\nThe number of violent crimes decreased in Florida throughout the 1990s, mirroring a national trend.\nAs for Crist\u2019s other statistic, it was actually happening more often than he said for most of the decade.\nThe year 1993 marked Crist\u2019s first year in the Florida Senate and a record-high amount of violent crimes (161,789). According to Florida Department of Law Enforcement data, a violent crime happened every three minutes and 14 seconds.\nThe figure stretched to three minutes and 19 seconds in 1994, and then to three minutes and 28 seconds in 1995.

Click here formoreon the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.","full_article":"Before Texas House Speaker\u00a0Joe Straus revealed he won\u2019t seek re-election\u00a0in 2018, a group declared that\u00a0activists accounting for more than half the state\u2019s Republican electorate\u00a0had\u00a0called for House leaders to skedaddle.\nThe New Leadership PAC introduced itself in an October 2017 press release\u00a0stating: \"NLP is the culmination of discussions among a growing movement of organizations, leaders and voters across the state. Evidence of the need for NLP is illustrated by the passage of resolutions demanding changes in House leadership by 54 (and growing) of Republican party county chapters that together represent over 50 percent of Texas Republican voters.\"\nVoters might question whether party honchos automatically represent their wishes. Still, we wondered if resolutions demanding changes won widespread adoption as described.\nThe PAC's release didn\u2019t single out House leaders by name. But the PAC\u2019s treasurer, Don Dyer of Austin, responded to our request for factual backup by emailing an undated document listing 56 of the state\u2019s 254 counties under the headline, \"Texas County GOP\u2019s Voting to Oust Straus,\" the San Antonio Republican in his record-tying\u00a0fifth two-year stint as speaker. House members fill the gavel-wielding leadership post from among themselves at\u00a0the start of each regular legislative session.\nWe unsuccessfully sought more information from Dyer, who told us whoever composed the list didn\u2019t want to be identified. Dyer also didn\u2019t provide copies of the referenced resolutions or the details of each proclaimed action.\nIndependent verification\nWe started our independent look into this claim by asking\u00a0the Republican Party of Texas about such actions by local parties. By email, spokesman Jamie Bennett replied\u00a0that county parties \"act autonomously and are not required to submit resolutions to the state party. Therefore, I do have any list of all relevant resolutions. The best way to get that info would be to contact county chairs individually.\"\nWe didn\u2019t have the resources to check all the counties listed by Dyer. But our reporting--based on interviews of local party officials plus news stories and web posts by county parties and Empower Texans, a group long intent on banishing Straus for his resistance to its agenda--showed that anti-Straus resolutions were approved by executive committees of Republican parties in 19 counties including the eight counties accounting for the greatest numerical turnouts in the state\u2019s latest GOP primary, in March 2016: Harris, Tarrant, Dallas, Bexar, Collin, Denton, Montgomery and Travis counties.\nAlso, you can make a case that the 19 parties represent more than half the state\u2019s Republicans. That is, state-posted election returns show\u00a0the 1,498,383 people who voted for president in those counties\u00a0comprised 53 percent of the 2,836,488 Texans who voted for president in the party's statewide primary.\u00a0About 1.4 million Texans voted in the Texas Democratic presidential primary.\nCounty-by-county confirmations\nWe turned next to confirming individual adoptions of anti-Straus resolutions.\nIn July 2017, Bexar County Republicans led the way by\u00a0adopting a resolution by 36-28 calling for \"a change in leadership in the Texas House speakership.\" That happened, in Straus's home county,\u00a0just before lawmakers began a special session on 20 topics designated by Gov. Greg Abbott including Abbott\u2019s desire, successfully resisted by Straus, for a public-school bathroom law targeting transgender people.\nLike others, the Bexar County resolution says the House\u2019s leadership should change due to Straus\u2019s failure to support the party\u2019s platform. The\u00a0latest platform, adopted by Texas GOP activists in 2016, spells out positions that nominees are expected to champion--among them, an end to the direct election of U.S. senators; abolition of about 10 federal agencies; passage of federal legislation remanding all authority over abortion to individual states--and, at the state level, \"enactment of legislation addressing individuals\u2019 use of bathrooms, showers and locker rooms that correspond with their biologically determined sex.\"\nIn a phone message, Ruth Pharis of the Comal County Republican Party confirmed that its executive committee on July 20, 2017 approved a resolution supporting a change in the House speaker. Hood County Republicans similarly acted before the special session, according to a memo from Jim Logan, the county party\u2019s chairman. \"Even though many pieces of legislation have been put forward that are in line with the Republican Party of Texas platform,\" the resolution says, \"Speaker Straus has failed to get them through the Texas House... We have no confidence going forward that he will adequately support the direction outlined by the platform and new leadership needs to be installed to effectively represent the will of the Republican Party of Texas voters and their platform.\"\nGOP leaders in Smith County likewise approved a resolution, though the Tyler Morning Telegraph quoted Brent Thompson, the county party\u2019s chair, calling the move \"symbolic\" and saying the resolution \"isn\u2019t going to accomplish anything more than show Speaker Straus where we stand.\"\nAn August 2017 Empower Texans web post says Liberty County Republicans that month approved a \"no confidence\" resolution calling for Straus to be censured by the state party\u2019s executive committee for \"his dismal failure to support\" the party\u2019s \"core principles.\" The resolution also contains passages suggesting Straus bends to Democratic wishes. Straus, unsaid, gained momentum as an aspirant for House speaker in 2009\u00a0thanks to backing from House Democrats and a few Republican House members.\nOn Aug. 7, 2017, Collin County Republicans voted 40-13 for a resolution in favor of House Republicans alone choosing the House speaker at the start of the 2019 regular session, Neal Katz, the county party\u2019s executive director, told us by phone.\nOn Aug. 17, 2017, the executive committee of the Denton County Republican Party approved a \"no confidence\" resolution demanding that \"our elected officials in the Texas House withdraw support\" from Straus. \"We believe that it is time for new leadership in the House in order to effectively represent the will of Texas voters,\" the resolution says.\nMontgomery County Republican Party leaders acted similarly by a 33-11 vote, according to an account in the Golden Hammer, a local publication. Wally Wilkerson, the county party\u2019s chairman, told us by phone the vote took place with most of the local party\u2019s 90 executive committee members not present. Wilkerson, who\u2019s chaired the local party since 1964, credited conservative activists. \"Core elements of both parties have to have a bogeyman,\" Wilkerson said.\nSeparately, Galveston County Republican Party leaders voted 14-2 to adopt a no-confidence resolution about Straus, Empower Texans reported\u00a0while\u00a0party leaders in Tom Green County adopted a resolution telling the county\u2019s House member to \"work to install\" a speaker who\u2019ll advance party platform directives, Jeff Betty, the county party\u2019s chairman, told us by email.\nAlso in August 2017, Republican precinct chairs in Hidalgo County voted in a straw poll by 20-0, with seven abstentions, to condemn Straus, according to a Rio Grande Guardian news story, though no resolution was taken up. The story quoted Jim Barnes, a tea-party activist, calling Straus an \"embedded Democrat.\"\nKaufman County Republicans approved a resolution calling for Straus to be removed as speaker for not heeding core platform principles, that party\u2019s chairman, Jimmy Weaver, confirmed by phone. In a phone message, Marty Rhymes of the Gregg County Republican Party said its leaders approved an anti-Straus resolution. \"We\u2019re definitely excited he\u2019s not going to run\" again, Rhymes said.\nAlso that month, Dallas County Republicans approved a resolution expressing \"no confidence\" in Straus, Ashley Moretti, the county party\u2019s executive director, confirmed by email.\nOn Sept. 25, 2017, the executive committee of the Harris County Republican Party approved--without a voiced dissent, party spokesman Vlad Davidiuk told us by phone--a resolution charging Straus with constantly obstructing the party\u2019s platform, \"resulting in a vast and deep disappointment among conservative grassroots voters.\" Also noted in the resolution: Straus referring in June 2017 to Abbott\u2019s special-session topics as \"horse manure.\"\nStraus, the resolution says, \"has consistently killed conservative legislation, advanced liberal bills and remains beholden to special interests. It is a demonstrable fact that Texas House Republicans will pass conservative bills if those bills ever get a \u2018floor\u2019 vote. The Speaker has consistently packed his committee chair assignments with Democrats and liberal Republicans in an effort to deliberately stall and kill conservative legislation,\" the resolution says.\nSeparately, Tarrant County Republicans adopted a call to choose a different speaker \"that will be fair and apply the rules equitably to all members of the House on all bills,\" the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported.\nAlso that month, Randall County Republican Party precinct leaders voted to tell local House members to vote against Straus for speaker, the Amarillo Globe News reported. And by a show of hands, precinct chairs for the Travis County Republican Party approved a resolution Sept. 12, 2017 calling for a change in the House speaker due to Straus\u2019s \"non-support\" of the party platform, the county party says on its website. The resolution said Straus had \"consistently denied the House the opportunity to act decisively upon conservative policies supported by Texas voters.\"\nOn Sept. 18, 2017, party leaders in Guadalupe County endorsed a resolution recommending that Straus be censured by the state party\u2019s executive committee \"for his dismal failure to support\" the platform\u2019s \"core principles,\" Karen Hale of the county party told us by email.\nIn Williamson County, in contrast, party leaders rejected an anti-Straus resolution by 31-14, the party\u2019s chairman, Bill Fairbrother, advised by phone. Fairbrother recalled debate about whether the move would hurt the county among lawmakers. Fairbrother said of Straus, \"There\u2019s a lot of respect for him here.\"\nWe queried Jason Embry, a Straus spokesman, about the PAC's claim. Embry replied with an email expressing Straus\u2019s gratitude for support from \"mainstream Republicans.\" The email didn\u2019t touch on resolutions adopted by leaders of county parties.","cleaned_claim":"County parties representing more than half the state\u2019s Republican voters approved resolutions demanding changes in Texas House leadership.","ambiguity_score":0.5450779796,"paraphrases":[["More than half of Texas' Republican voters have approved resolutions demanding changes in House leadership.",0.5450779796],["County parties representing more than half of Texas' Republican voters approved resolutions demanding changes in House leadership.",0.0116921496],["The county parties representing more than half of Texas' Republican voters approved resolutions calling for changes in the state House leadership.",0.0099189421],["More than half of the Republican voters in Texas have approved resolutions demanding changes in House leadership.",0.4675246477]]}

A 2011 tour of the renovated jet, posted on Trump\u2019s YouTube channel, has been viewed more than 8 million times. Its 24-karat gold-plated seat belts have been catalogued by the New York Times and the Washington Post.\nBut does Trump know his stuff when it comes to the state of U.S. military aviation?\nAt a June 16, 2016 stop in Dallas during a Trump fundraising swing through Texas, he ripped into U.S. reliance on outdated aircraft while selling newer technology to allies, telling the crowd:\n\"Remember, we\u2019re the ones with the jet fighters that are 20 years old that we have to go to graveyards, plane graveyards, to get parts to use on our jet fighters, to have our great young people to fly in planes where \u00a0they go into junk yards and museums to get parts for current fighters, while our opponents and our so-called allies are buying our planes, and they\u2019ve got the new beautiful versions of them, and we\u2019ve got old planes, I mean literally obsolete planes. It\u2019s not going to happen anymore, folks, ok?\"\nThe comments made us wonder \u2014 is the U.S. military really scrounging for parts in junkyards and museums? Are our jets really decades old? And do we sell newer and better planes to our allies while keeping older, inferior versions for ourselves?\nThe Trump campaign did not return a request for backup for Trump\u2019s claim, and the Air Force did not respond to repeated requests for comment, so we did some searching and asked a few third-party experts for information on Trump\u2019s points.\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s true that some of U.S. military planes are 20 years old \u2014 and some are much older.\nContacted by email, Carl Rhodes, director of Force Modernization and Employment Program at RAND Project AIR FORCE, a federally funded research and development center that provides analytical support to the Air Force, told us \"some are over 60 years old like the B-52\" while \"others are brand new, like the F-22 and F-35.\"\nAt a Feb. 9, 2016, news conference, Major General James F. Martin Jr., the Air Force deputy assistant secretary for budget, said the average age of its aircraft is over 27.\nThe Air Force Posture Statement for fiscal year 2017, released on February 10, 2016, states that makes the current fleet the oldest ever: \"While our Airmen remain heavily engaged around the world, the average age of our aircraft is at an all-time high, and the size of our force and state of our full-spectrum readiness are at or near all-time lows.\"\nSo, Trump has a point about the U.S. Air Force relying on older planes.\nTo our inquiry, Rhodes also confirmed that Air Force maintenance workers pull parts from warehoused planes, directing us to a Jan. 30, 2013 news feature story in AIRMAN, published by the Air Force Office of Public Affairs. According to the story, reclamation teams with the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group save time and money by pulling parts that are still functional from shelved \u00a0planes, sparing the Air Force from waiting longer for new parts to be made.\nAccording to a fact sheet we spotted on the Air Force\u2019s website, since 1964, U.S. military aircraft have been stored and disposed of by Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Davis-Monthan was first established as an aircraft storage facility following World War II. According to a February 4, 2003 PBS story, the practice of removing parts from the junked planes dates to the 1950s.\nSo, must the government go to \"graveyards\" to get parts?\n\"Probably not,\" Rhodes told us, \"but it can save quite a bit of money versus buying all new parts and keeping a sufficient stockpile.\"\nHow much money, exactly? Col. Robert Lepper, Commander of the 309th AMARG, told an Arizona news service in 2014 that the group returns about a half billion dollars worth of parts into service each year.\nRhodes also offered an example that supports Trump\u2019s claim that in some cases, the U.S. sells planes more advanced than the ones they themselves are using. \"We are selling F-16s to the UAE which are more advanced than our USAF F-16s,\" he said.\nRhodes pointed us to a January 2014 news post on Defense Industry Daily, a trade publication focused on defense acquisition, stating the United Arab Emirates invested $3 billion in research to develop the planes, which are made by Lockheed Martin.\nLockheed Martin, the number one US government contractor overall and within the Air Force sub-sector in fiscal year 2015, reported about 20% of their annual sales revenue came from sales to foreign entities, according to their SEC filings from 2010. Their filings report aircraft sales to countries including Israel, Kuwait, South Korea, and Tunisia. Over 25 countries purchased Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-16 Fighting Falcon, and 15 have purchased the C-130J Super Hercules.\nBoeing is the number two Air Space contractor. Some 62% of Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space and Security Revenue comes from the U.S. Department of Defense, according to the company\u2019s 2015 annual report. International customers account for \"roughly one-third of revenue and 40 percent of current backlog\" for the company. International sales account for a much smaller portion of the sales of the number three company, Northrop Grumman, according to their annual report -- 14 percent of the $23.5 billion total.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s own Defense Security Cooperation Agency\u2019s web site acknowledges an uptick in foreign demand, noting in a 2014 publication, \"While the United States and European Union are cutting their defense expenditures, several countries \u2014 particularly in East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and South America \u2014 are increasing expenditures. Hence, U.S. Contractors are increasingly seeking to sell products and services to these markets.\"\nBut experts we spoke to said that selling planes to other nations isn\u2019t relevant to the state of our own military aviation.\nTodd Harrison, director of Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, commented by email: \"The fact that U.S. companies are selling planes to other countries is not relevant. Those same companies are also selling planes to the U.S. military right now, and in many cases the U.S. is getting significantly better aircraft than our allies and partners. And what would the alternative be \u2014 block U.S. companies from selling aircraft to others? \u00a0Then our allies and partners would be less capable and even more dependent on us for security, putting an even greater strain on our forces.\"\nObaid Younossi, director of resource management at RAND Project AIR FORCE, agreed by email that foreign military sales are a plus for the U.S.\n\"We still make and keep the best of best for us: F-22, F-35, KC-46, F\/A-18E\/F, E-2D, and P-8. There are certainly versions of F-35 and F-18E\/F we sell to our allies, but the vast majority of what is coming out of production is for our Services,\" Younossi wrote. \"FMS [Foreign Military Sales] is good not only for strategic reasons but also for economic reasons. \u00a0It keeps costs down for us, keeps our industrial base in business, and helps pay for development of technology (i.e. F-16 Block 60 and Kuwaiti investments),\" Younossi said.\n\"Do we need to worry about modernization?,\" Younossi wrote, adding: \"Yes but not for reasons cited. \u00a0Some of the old work horses can still do the job but we need new ones to counter future threats.\"\nIn October 2015, the Pentagon awarded a contract to Northrop Grumman Corp. to build the first new bombers since the Cold War, which are to be deployed in the 2020s.\nSince Trump assured his audience \"it\u2019s not going to happen anymore, folks,\" it\u2019s worth noting that updating the military\u2019s aging fleet isn\u2019t the kind of job that can be done overnight \u2014 nor is it fully within the hands of the executive branch, as funding levels, determined by Congress, have contributed to readiness problems. according to Air Force officials like Chief of Staff Mark Welsh and Secretary Deborah Lee James..","cleaned_claim":"The U.S. has to go to plane graveyards and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters while it sells new jets to other countries.","ambiguity_score":0.1924571246,"paraphrases":[["The United States has to scrounge for parts from old planes in graveyards and museums to keep its 20-year-old jet fighters running, while it sells new jets to other countries.",0.1924571246],["The U.S. is selling new jets to other countries while it has to go to plane graveyards and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters.",0.129722178],["While the United States is selling new fighter jets to other countries, it has to go to plane graveyards and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jets.",0.0468658395],["The U.S. has to source parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters from plane graveyards and museums, while it sells new jets to other countries.",0.0271588936],["While the United States sells new jet fighters to other countries, it has to go to plane graveyards and museums to get parts for its 20-year-old jet fighters.",0.0657974184]]}

Diesel (and gas) prices are rising due to swelling demand as movement and economic activity increase amid the coronavirus recovery. Expert say it could take until 2022 for oil production to return to pre-pandemic levels, causing a shortage in the meantime that will drive prices up.\nWe rate this claim Pants on Fire.","full_article":"A new party in the White House means it\u2019s time for a time-honored American tradition \u2014 the blame game.\nAnything wrong in the world is now the fault of the two-month old administration. Or the fault of the prior administration, depending on your political persuasion.\nWith gas prices on the move, this exercise is in full effect on social media. That includes a widely-shared March 10, 2021 Facebook post.\n\"When Sleepy Joe Came In Diesel Was $1.69,\" it reads. \"Today Diesel Is $3.19. Thanks To All That Voted For This Clown.\"\nThis post was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook).\nThis poster gets it wrong on both the specifics and the blame. Here\u2019s why.\nWrong numbers\nDiesel prices are indeed up. The March 15 national average of $3.07 was the highest since June 2019.\nBut the numbers in the post are way off the mark.\nThe national average price for diesel was $2.64 per gallon on Jan. 20 when President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took the oath of office, according to GasBuddy.com price trackers. That\u2019s almost a dollar higher than the post claims. Meanwhile, the March 10 national average was $3.04, less than the post claimed.\nSo, there was an increase, but a far smaller one.\nWeekly price data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows similar movement, from $2.70 to $3.14 based on the weeks closest to those points in time.\nIn Wisconsin, meanwhile, diesel rose from $2.50 to $2.90 between January 20 and March 10, according to GasBuddy.\nThe poster did not respond to a message from PolitiFact Wisconsin seeking evidence of his claim. He lives in Iowa, according to his profile, but using local numbers doesn\u2019t help his case much. GasBuddy shows prices in Des Moines rose over that span from $2.45 to $3.00 per gallon, a slightly larger jump, but still far from the post\u2019s claim.\nBiden not to blame for spikes\nThe post \u2014 like many others pointing a finger at Biden over prices at the pump \u2014 is also wrong on the fundamental blame element. The price movement we\u2019re seeing now on both diesel and gas isn\u2019t related to Biden\u2019s policy changes, experts say.\nFor starters, the trend predates Biden. Diesel prices have steadily risen since the start of November, when Republican President Donald Trump was in office.\nAnd Biden\u2019s policies aren\u2019t having any immediate impact. Biden shut down the planned Keystone XL pipeline expansion, which was to run from Canada to Nebraska. Experts consulted by PolitiFact said that decision could make oil transportation less efficient longterm, but even then they doubted it would directly affect US costs. Reuters reports existing pipelines and ongoing expansions are expected to be sufficient for the flow between the U.S. and Canada, which provides about half of America\u2019s imported oil.\nThe president also imposed a 60-day ban on new fracking permits, but that doesn\u2019t affect existing operations. Oil producers weren\u2019t likely to be pursuing new locations now anyhow since they\u2019re scrambling to bring back online production that was scaled back in 2020, experts say.\nIn reality, diesel and gas prices \u2014 like many things in 2021 \u2014 are all about the pandemic.\nThe reduction of economic activity, and people traveling and moving around less, reduced demand for diesel and gas both in 2020, causing a related drop in oil production amid steep financial losses in the oil industry. The Energy Information Administration, an independent government agency that provides analysis for policymakers and the public, said demand for diesel fell 8% in 2020, while demand for gas dropped by 13%.\nDemand is now rising quickly as the COVID-19 picture improves and the economy rebounds, but it takes time to get the supply back to normal. The Energy Information Administration says crude oil production in the U.S. was down in 2020 and will drop again in 2021 \"as a result of a decline in drilling activity related to low oil prices.\" It projects an increase in 2022.\n\"We\u2019re headed for higher (price) territory until the market sees more crude oil, whether that\u2019s supplied from the U.S. or Canadian interests or OPEC,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy.com. \"We are in a pretty significant imbalance. Demand has screamed higher, and production has been moving at a turtle\u2019s pace, and part of that is because the depths of the crisis were so severe for oil companies.\"\nEnergy and security analyst Patricia Schouker described the same dynamic to AFP, a France-based global news agency, saying recovering demand and limited production has \"pushed crude prices to their highest levels since near the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\"\nOutside of market-altering events like the pandemic, prices of both fuels are driven primarily by the cost of crude oil, which is in turn driven by an array of world economic conditions that influence supply and demand.\nAs Schouker noted, presidents have \"\u2018very little direct influence\" over gas and diesel prices.\nDe Haan said the irony of blaming Biden is that the increasing demand is related to the growing economy. So the people prone to wrongly blame Biden for gas prices would also be slow to credit him for the economy, even though those are two sides of the same coin.","cleaned_claim":"Diesel prices jumped from $1.69 to $3.19 since Biden took office, and the president is to blame.","ambiguity_score":0.4680913389,"paraphrases":[["Since Biden took office, diesel prices have increased significantly, and many people believe that the president is to blame.",0.2606184781],["Diesel prices have increased significantly since Biden took office, and many people believe that the president is to blame.",0.2926362753],["Diesel prices have more than doubled since Biden took office, and many people believe that the president is to blame.",0.4680913389],["Since Biden took office, the price of diesel has more than doubled from $1.69 to $3.19, and the president is to blame.",0.4615885913],["Since Biden took office, diesel prices have more than doubled, and the president is to blame.",0.2432311326]]}

Instead, Donnelly co-sponsored bills, wrote amendments and crafted language that made its way into 43 laws during his single Senate term.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.","full_article":"Joe Donnelly, incumbent senator running for re-election in Indiana, touted his effective lawmaking during a seven-day campaign trip around the state.\n\"43 of Joe\u2019s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office,\" an Aug. 8 press release from the Donnelly campaign read.\nThe campaign has repeated this figure time and again, on the road and in campaign statements. It contradicts, however, what President Donald Trump said about Donnelly, whom he dubbed \"Sleepin\u2019 Joe\" during a May 11 campaign rally for Republican challenger Mike Braun.\n\"The Center for Effective Lawmaking named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate,\" Trump said. \"He's never sponsored a bill that has become a law.\"\nSo who\u2019s right? In a way, both are correct.\nThe Center for Effective Lawmaking, a nonpartisan research project run by two political science professors, assigns credit based on who is the sponsor of a bill, as recorded by the Library of Congress. Based on that definition, Donnelly has never sponsored a bill that became a law during his first term in the Senate.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean none of his legislative proposals in the Senate have become law.\nCraig Volden, who co-directs the center, noted that the criteria for advancing a legislative proposal could be broadened.\nA closer search of the Library of Congress database shows 28 bills that became law on which Donnelly was among the co-sponsors. He was an original co-sponsor, a higher bar, on five of these.\nLanguage from Donnelly\u2019s bills, and from amendments he proposed, have also made their way into law, mostly through annual budget acts. In all, these add up to 43 total and 17 under Trump.\nFor example, Donnelly introduced a bill in 2013 to improve suicide prevention efforts in the military. The bill didn\u2019t get far on its own, but Donnelly got the proposal passed in the National Defense Authorization Act in 2014 as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nMore recently, Donnelly helped author Right to Try, a bill aimed at getting drugs that had not been FDA-approved to terminally ill patients. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., was the sponsor of the bill, so Donnelly didn\u2019t get that credit on Congress.gov \u2014 but Johnson gave it to him at a press conference.\n\"My primary co-sponsor, Sen. Donnelly, was a stalwart,\" Johnson said. \"This would not have happened without Joe Donnelly.\"\nVolden said that while valid measures of effectiveness, \"there is no similar comprehensive measure of the other senators in this regard that would allow a systematic comparison and ranking of senators on these criteria.\"\nExperts told us being in the minority in a divided Congress makes it harder for Donnelly to have gotten much passed anyway. Donnelly took office in 2013, and Democrats held the majority until 2015.\n\"As you can see, passing the version he sponsors would let him claim credit easily \u2014 incorporating it elsewhere would not,\" said Corrine McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University. \"Partisans busy undermining each other absolutely may seek ways to prevent credit-claiming by the other party's members.\"\nThat said, Donnelly has demonstrated willingness to cross the aisle.\nThe Lugar Center's Bipartisan Index (named for former Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.)\u00a0measures the frequency with which a member gets co-sponsors for their bills from the other party and the frequency with which they co-sponsor bills introduced by the other party.

Mark Pocan, D-Wisconsin, who co-sponsored a bill in 2019 to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024.\nThe bill passed in the House in July 2019 and is stalled in the Senate, but Pocan is still talking about wage growth \u2014 most recently in his endorsement of Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nIn a Jan. 16, 2020 video with Sanders posted on Twitter, Pocan described an advertisement he saw for the Amazon distribution center in his hometown of Kenosha, seeking workers for $12.75 an hour.\n\"Your parents made that three decades ago, and that\u2019s what people are making now,\" Pocan said to the camera.\nIs Pocan right on the numbers?\nAnd what about his underlying point: that real wages haven\u2019t changed much in 30 years?\nWe checked it out.\nCrunching the numbers\nWhen asked for evidence to back up Pocan\u2019s claim, communications director Usamah Andrabi provided historical pay data for the nation\u2019s auto industry and the median income for Wisconsin men and women according to the 1990 census.\nAndrabi said Pocan often uses auto worker pay to make his point, because auto manufacturing was the dominant industry in Kenosha when he was growing up there.\nBut Pocan did not mention auto pay in his claim, and pay in that industry historically is far higher than many other jobs. So, we focused on the weekly and hourly earnings data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nLet\u2019s walk through the math.\nDennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, said the best metric to use in examining the claim is median wages \u2014 and, of course, to examine them in \"real\" terms, to compare the spending power over time.\nThe median wage for Americans in December 1990 was $417 per week, which breaks down to $10.43 an hour.\nFast-forward three decades, and the median wage for Americans in December 2019 was $933 per week, or $23.33 an hour.\nThat might look like a significant increase.\nBut using the Bureau\u2019s inflation calculator, the 1990 weekly wage translates to $800.88 per week in today\u2019s dollars, or $20.02 an hour. So, that\u2019s a roughly $3 increase in 30 years.\nFrom a narrow perspective, Pocan is off \u2014 an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in.\nHe fares much better when considering the larger point being made: That wage growth has been largely stagnant.\nAn August 2018 study from the Pew Research Center showed that at least since 2000, most of the country\u2019s wage growth is distributed among the top 10% of earners.\nFor those closer to the median and below it, the growth line is nearly flat.\nWhat\u2019s more, the cost of living has undergone a much steeper hike: from 1983 to 2013, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a roughly 3% annual increase in rent and food prices, and a 1.3% annual increase in new vehicle prices.\nSo, a small growth in median wages is dwarfed next to the rise in cost of other goods.","cleaned_claim":"There\u2019s an Amazon distribution center that was advertising, last time I was there, up to $12.75 an hour.

Use real people, not phony sources.\"\nReporters from multiple outlets began pushing back on the notion that the New York\u00a0Times had fabricated a source. The White House, they said, had actually furnished the source that Trump denied existing.\nThey said the official did indeed exist; in fact, he had conducted \"an off-camera, not for broadcast, background briefing on North Korea,\" in the wording of the White House email that had announced it on May 24.\nThe briefing had been held in the White House press room and was opened up to reporters elsewhere via a conference call line. Under the ground rules of a \"background briefing,\" reporters cannot use the name of the specific official and instead must use a more vague descriptor.\nThe New York\u00a0Times published a story after Trump sent his tweet, headlined, \"Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting.\" It said that the source referred to in the article \"was in fact a senior White House official speaking to a large group of reporters in the White House briefing room.\"\nMargaret Talev, the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, tweeted that she shared her \"colleagues\u2019 conclusion.\"\nSo what\u2019s going on here? We did our own review. We found\u00a0Trump was wrong in saying that the source \"doesn\u2019t exist\" and was \"phony.\" Evidence shows Trump's own White House arranged the briefing with the official.\nDid the source exist?\nYes. This can be demonstrated by audio released on Twitter by Yashar Ali, a contributor to New York magazine and HuffPost. The clip offers the first minute and a half of the background briefing.\u00a0(The audio is actually video of the press room\u2019s empty lectern as it it records sound elsewhere in the room.)\nSome media outlets have not published the briefer\u2019s name, including many outlets who participated in the briefing and felt they were bound by the original agreement not to publish the name. However, other outlets have subsequently published the name made available in the audio Ali tweeted.\nPolitiFact will reprint the briefer\u2019s name for a few reasons: It is needed to full address the accuracy of Trump\u2019s charge; the information is now readily available on the Internet; and we were not a participant in the original briefing and did not agree to keep it on background.\nThe briefer was Matthew Pottinger, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Asian affairs.\nHere\u2019s a transcript of the audio segment Ali tweeted:\nWhite House press official: \"This briefing\u2019s going to be on background, off camera, not for broadcast. Pottinger here can be referred to as a senior White House official. He is deputy assistant to the president for Asia. And you can take it from here.\"\nReporter: \"Can you clarify that the president obviously announced in the letter that the particular time and date of the summit is called off. Later, he said it\u2019s possible the existing summit could take place, or a summit at a later date. Is he saying it\u2019s possible that June 12 could still happen?\"\nPottinger: \"The main point, I suppose, is that the ball\u2019s in North Korea\u2019s court right now. And there's really not a lot of time. We've lost quite a bit of time that we would need in order to \u2014 I mean there's an enormous amount of preparation that's gone on over the past few months in the White House, at State, and with other agencies and so forth, but there's a certain amount of actual dialogue that needs to take place at the working level with your counterparts to ensure that the agenda is clear in the minds of those two leaders when they sit down to actually meet and talk and negotiate and hopefully make a deal. And June 12 is in 10 minutes and it's going to be, you know \u2014 but the president has said that he some day looks forward to meeting\u2026\"\nThe White House declined to either confirm or deny to PolitiFact that Pottinger was the briefer. But the audio\u00a0speaks for itself.\nTrump's underlying issue with the\u00a0New York Times report might have to do with its\u00a0paraphrase of what the official said.\nPottinger was certainly skeptical that a summit could happen on the original date, but he never actually used the word \"impossible\" \u2014 which is the phrasing the New York\u00a0Times\u2019 article had used.\nThe White House argues that Trump\u2019s incredulity is justified because, despite the New York\u00a0Times\u2019 characterization, nobody said in the briefing that a summit would be \"impossible.\"\nThat said, the New York\u00a0Times paraphrased Pottinger rather than quoting him, as Trump said in his tweet.

Johnson School of Public Affairs. \"From Washington to Trump, every president has faced serious criticism from domestic adversaries and various groups. That is as American as apple pie.\"\nBut even if you define the issue more broadly, Trump\u2019s statement lacks evidence.\nFor a quick-and-dirty analysis, we looked at two statistics that measure the strength of the economy and public support for every post-World War II president: the unemployment rate, and the president\u2019s approval rating from the polling firm Gallup.\nWe found four presidents -- Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon\u00a0and George W. Bush -- who experienced roughly similar low unemployment rates as Trump but whose approval percentages ranged from the low 20s to the high 30s.\nHere\u2019s a summary:\nTruman\u2019s strong-economy doldrums lasted for the better part of two years, Johnson\u2019s for a year and a half, Nixon\u2019s for a couple of months, and Bush\u2019s for about six months.\nWhat they all shared is a major issue other than the economy that sapped public support.\n\"If a president has a good economy, it gives them the chance to get a good approval rating -- but it\u2019s not a guarantee,\" said Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Southern Methodist University Center for Presidential History.\nFor Truman, Johnson and Bush, a war proved unpopular. For Nixon, it was Watergate.\n\"War, when it is protracted, tends to be a downer for presidential approval,\" said Bert A. Rockman, an emeritus political science professor at Purdue University. \"All things being equal, a booming economy is a help to a president, unless they are caught up in conflicts that produce high numbers of casualties over a protracted period of time and that seem to be at an impasse.\"\nJohnson faced problems beyond the Vietnam War. \"I think he could have survived the war if not for race riots and assassinations,\" Engel said. \"It wasn\u2019t just one thing. It was the multiplicity of them.\"\nEven presidents who maintain their approval ratings aren\u2019t immune from \"criticism\" during good economic times, Suri said.\nJohnson and Bill Clinton \"were presidents during two of the best economic periods in post-war U.S. history, but both faced intensive criticism from Republicans and some Democrats,\" Suri said. \"The Republicans impeached Clinton at a moment of very low unemployment, strong economic growth, and even a budget surplus.\" (Clinton\u2019s approval rating on the eve of his impeachment vote in the House was 63 percent.)\nLow unemployment rates don\u2019t guarantee that everyone will be happy with the economy, either, Suri added.\n\"There is also the question of who benefits from good economic numbers,\" he said. \"Growing inequality, despite low unemployment, has been a source of criticism for all presidents since at least Nixon.\"\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry.","cleaned_claim":"In the \u2018old days\u2019 if you were president and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.","ambiguity_score":0.1065740585,"paraphrases":[["In the past, if a president had a good economy, they were rarely criticized.",0.0226075221],["In the past, if a president had a good economy, they were not likely to be criticized.",0.015124063],["In the past, if a president had a good economy, they were immune from criticism.",0.1065740585],["If you were president and had a good economy in the past, you were rarely criticized.",0.0266943425]]}

Cuomo said these words more than two years ago, before Clinton declared herself a presidential candidate.\nGiven this backdrop, the most plausible interpretation is that Cuomo was noting Clinton\u2019s reliance on \"free\" media from outlets like CNN at a time when she would not have been able to run campaign ads or other electoral-advocacy efforts. And Cuomo\u2019s smile \u2014 along with his comment that the campaign \"better happen\" after all the time they spent covering Clinton\u2019s book \u2014 suggests that he\u2019s being a bit smart-alecky rather than fully serious.\nWe rate the statement Mostly False.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/d143b10e-2d06-49ce-ba24-faccf31aa6fa","full_article":"The media has been one of Donald Trump\u2019s most consistent targets during his 2016 presidential campaign.

It then quoted a comment attributed to CNN morning anchor Chris Cuomo: \"We couldn't help her any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign.\"\nThe email, signed by Brad Parscale of \"Team TRUMP,\" provides links to donate money and includes the following GIF of CNN\u2019s Cuomo.\nWe decided to see whether Cuomo did in fact say, \"We couldn't help her (Hillary Clinton) any more than we have. She's got a free ride so far from the media. We're the biggest ones supporting her campaign.\"\nWe found that Cuomo did say those words -- but that their meaning is not as clear-cut as the Trump campaign indicates. (CNN declined an opportunity to comment.\u00a0Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond\u00a0to inquiries.)\nCuomo\u2019s comment came on the show he co-anchors, New Day\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but a crucial fact not mentioned by the Trump campaign email is that the comments came more than two years ago, on June 9, 2014.\nThat timing makes a significant difference for the meaning of Cuomo\u2019s words.\nIn mid 2014, Clinton was widely believed to be a presidential candidate in waiting, but she had not officially announced that she was running for the White House. She did not officially announce her candidacy until April 12, 2015, \u00a0more than 10 months after the CNN exchange aired.\nThe news peg for the CNN discussion was the media promotion that Clinton was doing in advance of the June 10, 2014, publication of her book, Hard Choices: A Memoir.\nFor someone who was officially a non-candidate for president, Clinton\u2019s book-promotion efforts enabled her to get some \"earned\" media, meaning news coverage without having to pay for ads. That\u2019s the backdrop for the CNN discussion, as this excerpt shows:\nBrianna Keilar, CNN correspondent: \"So, trying to downplay the issue there, but this book is part of the big book rollout. There will be other interviews. There will be a lot of speeches. There will be book signings. And all of it, Brooke and Chris, is designed to sell books and keep her well positioned for a 2016 run.\"\nBrooke Baldwin, CNN co-anchor: \"We talked about this before, nothing is on accident, this is all perfectly choreographed to read through the tea leaves of whatever it is she says this week. But, you know, Diane Sawyer (of ABC) said to her, you know, listen, it sort of seems the party is frozen right now. So, let me ask you about that about the people who may possibly run against her at least on the left side of the aisle. She said that they can do whatever they choose to do in whatever timetable they decide. But that's not entirely true.\"\nKeilar: \"No, it's not really true. I mean, there's not a whole lot maybe she can do about it right now, because I think pretty much, everyone agrees, the sooner she gets into this race, the trickier it is for her. But largely right now when you're looking at staff picks and fundraising, those folks are kind of holding their fire. So, I think she has, if she decides she is probably going to run, she's got a little more time. If she's thinking she may not run, then she kind of needs to get out of the way and let some of these Democrats, you know, make headway when it comes to fundraising and stuff.\"\nCuomo: \"What your guys\u2019 take on this? I was actually happy that Diane pressed her the way she did. You know, it's a dicey move because when Hillary becomes candidate and becomes the presumptive candidate, that can come back and hurt you. But Diane pressed her anyway and got her to say, yes, by the end of the year. That's early, by the way, right, Brianna? I mean, you know, if she says end of the year, I'm in, she's early.\" ...\nBaldwin: \"Okay, Brianna, thank you very much. We'll be talking about this later on in the morning. But just quickly, to your point, I mean, if it does take quite a while longer, what happens to the other folks who want to attempt to run against her?\"\nCuomo: \"Because she's doing what they call in politics, freezing pockets, because the donors are giving her money thinking she's going to run. That means they're not going to have available money for other candidates --\"\nBaldwin: \"Exactly.\"\nCuomo: \"-- if she doesn't and I don't think she's going to give it to them.\"\nBaldwin: \"She's on her way.\"\nCuomo: \"We'll see. We couldn't help her any more than we have. She's got just a free ride, so far, from the media. We're the biggest ones promoting her campaign. So, it better happen.\"\nSo those were Cuomo\u2019s words. But there is a strong argument for an alternative, and far less controversial, interpretation than the one the Trump campaign offered.\nThe first thing to note is that the \"help\" Cuomo is referring to is the advance coverage of Clinton\u2019s book release. This is the same type of \"earned media\" that Trump has built his campaign on. For both candidates, political celebrity plus newsworthy comments equals media coverage.\nAnd by \"free ride,\" Cuomo isn\u2019t saying that the media has been unquestioning toward Clinton. Quite the opposite \u2014 Cuomo applauded what he saw as Sawyer\u2019s tough questioning of Clinton. Moments before the quote highlighted by the Trump campaign, Cuomo specifically said, \"I was actually happy that Diane pressed her the way she did. You know, it's a dicey move because when Hillary becomes candidate and becomes the presumptive candidate, that can come back and hurt you.\"\nThe \"free ride\" for Clinton seems to refer to the earned \u2014 literally, \"free\" \u2014 media coverage that Clinton was enjoying at the time, much as Trump eventually would. It was \"free\" in the sense that Clinton didn\u2019t have to pay a dime for the coverage of her book release.\nThe same logic can be used to support Cuomo\u2019s comment that \"we\u2019re the biggest ones promoting her campaign.\" He doesn\u2019t mean \"promote\" in the sense of \"support the election of,\" but rather \"give a media platform to,\" at a time when she would not be able to run paid presidential campaign ads.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that, if you watch the original video, Cuomo is smiling as he banters with Baldwin. When Cuomo says, \"So it better happen,\" which is a portion of the quote that doesn\u2019t appear in the Trump email, he appears to be joking that it would all be a big waste of journalists\u2019 time if Clinton didn\u2019t end up running for president.","cleaned_claim":"A CNN anchor said that Hillary Clinton has gotten a free ride so far from the media.

And a conservative-leaning court did rule to let stand a new North Dakota voter ID law that requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address \u2014 but the new ninth member did not participate.\nNorth Dakota\u2019s law does pose obstacles for many tribal citizens who don\u2019t have street addresses. However, through the work of voter rights advocates and officials with the Secretary of State\u2019s office, there are ways that Native American voters who have PO boxes instead of residential street addresses will be able to vote. The law does not mean they are losing their right to vote altogether.\nThe group also said that Native Americans were the last U.S. citizens to be granted the right to vote and the first to lose them. Native Americans in Utah were the last ethnic group to be recognized by both state and federal law as citizens with voting rights. But it wasn\u2019t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that federal law more thoroughly addressed issues of voter discrimination for all people, giving underrepresented voters of many ethnicities the actual right and means to vote.\nFor a mixed bag of accuracy, we rate this claim Half True.","full_article":"A viral image about Native American voting rights in North Dakota\u00a0called a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision \"disgraceful.\"\nThe liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats circulated a graphic in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Oct. 9\u00a0decision not to intervene in a challenge to North Dakota\u2019s voter ID law that would require voters to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that displays a current residential street address.\nThe graphic was posted to Occupy Democrats\u2019 Facebook page along with a link to an American Civil Liberties Union article encouraging users to read more. The image shows a picture of Chief Joseph, a leader of the Nez Perc\u00e9 tribe in the Pacific Northwest, along with a paragraph about how the decision will affect Native Americans:\n\"The Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO boxes. The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it\u2019s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote. Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it.\"\nThis image was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had been shared on Facebook more than 52,000 times.\nThere are a lot of parts to this claim, so we will take them one by one.\nRecent changes to North Dakota\u2019s voter ID laws\nSigned into law by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2017, HB 1369 requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address in North Dakota.\nThe bill stipulates that a driver\u2019s license, Department of Transportation-issued ID, or tribal government-issued ID are acceptable forms of identification, and allows for other documents, such as a utility bill or paycheck, to supplement missing or outdated information.\nNorth Dakota is the only state without voter registration, abolishing it in 1951, according to the Secretary of State\u2019s office.\nA group of eight Native Americans from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa had already been in a legal battle with the state over voting rights when Burgum enacted Republican-led HB 1369. So, in December 2017, the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys for the Native American Rights Fund,\u00a0amended their original January 2016 complaint, Brakebill vs. Jaeger, and asked a federal judge to declare the new law unconstitutional. They argued\u00a0it violates the national Voting Rights Act.\nThe plaintiffs argued that the law was discriminatory because, \"most tribal IDs do not have a residential address printed on them. This is due, in part, to the fact that the U.S. postal service does not provide residential delivery in these rural Indian communities. Thus, most tribal members use a PO Box.\"\nReached by email, Occupy Democrats told PolitiFact that the organization should have specified in their graphic that Native Americans \"in remote areas\" use PO boxes.\n\"But we stand by the general veracity of the statement, especially with regards to this specific example in North Dakota,\" Occupy Democrats wrote in the Oct. 18 email.\nIn April, Judge Daniel L. Hovland of the U.S. District Court of North Dakota blocked the bill\u2019s new requirements from being enforced. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, allowing the street address requirement to be implemented in the upcoming midterm elections. In September, the Native American Rights Fund took the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s ruling\nOccupy Democrats\u2019 graphic also said, \"The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it\u2019s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote.\"\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on Brakebill vs. Jaeger was 6-2, with justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting.\nNewly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the decision. It is generally accepted by political scholars, however, that Kavanaugh\u2019s addition to the court means there is a conservative-majority tilt.\nWith the Supreme Court declining to intervene, North Dakota\u2019s voter ID law and its street address requirements will remain in place. However, the U.S. Supreme Court didn\u2019t make a legal determination on the basis of North Dakota\u2019s law. It simply decided not to intervene.\nWere Native Americans the last to get the right to vote?\nThe graphic also said, \"Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it.\"\nThat\u2019s partially accurate, but the timeline of American\u00a0voting rights is far less cut-and-dried than that statement might suggest.\nOver the course of history, all but a very small segment of the people who live in the U.S. have had to fight for the right to vote. At the nation\u2019s founding in 1776, only property-owning Protestants over the age of 21 (most of whom were white and male) were given the right to vote.\nEveryone else had to see laws changed in order to cast a ballot.\nIn 1870, the passage of the 15th Amendment meant that, in theory, African-American men could vote. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act gave Native Americans citizenship rights, including the right to vote. And in 1952, the McCarren-Walter Act eliminated laws that prevented Asians from becoming naturalized citizens, which included voting rights.\nIn each case, however, the law on the books didn\u2019t necessarily reflect what was happening when people showed up at their polling places to try to cast a ballot.\nIn reality, Native Americans were turned away from casting ballots in New Mexico and Arizona until 1948, when courts ruled in their favor against state government. In Utah, Native Americans weren\u2019t allowed to vote until 1957, becoming the last of America\u2019s indigenous people to be formally recognized as citizens.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the United States applied strong legal spackle to the question of voting rights, filling in the many holes and cracks that, for hundreds of years, permitted elections officials to discriminate against citizens who sought to cast a ballot on Election Day.\nThe new law was primarily championed by black Civil Rights leaders, but it ultimately\u00a0extended protections to people of all backgrounds by prohibiting poll taxes, literacy tests, election fraud and voter intimidation \u2014 tactics that had been used to thwart Native Americans from voting.\nDoes a PO Box really mean you can\u2019t vote?\nOccupy Democrats\u2019 graphic claimed that because of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Native Americans in North Dakota who only have PO boxes will be unable to vote.\nHowever, news reports show that tribal officials and a voting rights advocacy group called Four Directions are working with the Secretary of State\u2019s office to pave ways for those who have PO boxes to be able to go to their polling places with other documentation that will allow them to cast their ballots. These include efforts to help residents secure other acceptable forms of ID to present at the polls.\nThe Associated Press on Oct. 19 reported that \"tribal officials can issue a tribal voting letter with the eligible voter's name, date of birth and residential address at polling locations on reservations,\" a proposal that Deputy Secretary of State Jim Silrum said would be considered valid ID.\nIn her dissent, Justice Ginsburg noted that the numbers of North Dakota residents who are affected by this change is significant: \"1) 70,000 North Dakota residents -- about 20 percent of the turnout in a regular quadrennial election -- lack qualifying ID; and 2) approximately 18,000 residents lack supplemental documentation sufficient to permit them to vote without an ID.\"\nThat means that voting rights advocates have a huge job ahead of them to ensure those affected by the law are able to go to the polls with acceptable ID.","cleaned_claim":"The Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO boxes.

Here\u2019s what we found out.\nCDC asked to revise guidelines\nBiden\u2019s campaign pointed us to a May 7, 2020, Associated Press report, which found that the Trump administration shelved part of a CDC document that contained step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen businesses and public areas amid the pandemic.\nThe 68-page CDC report, titled \"Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,\" was supposed to publish on May 1, according to the AP, but the White House called it \"too prescriptive.\" The White House told the agency revise its guide because it didn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s strategy of giving states the final say.\nThe CDC released the approved 62-page report on May 20. (Some sections were released a few days earlier.) While it\u2019s slightly shorter than the original, it still provides a detailed reopening roadmap for schools, camps, restaurants, child care facilities and transit organizations.\nIn a May 8 press briefing, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany countered that the CDC guidelines weren't ready and said that a rogue employee leaked a draft that was still in the editing process.\nAfter the final guidelines were released, she was asked in another briefing why Trump didn\u2019t make an announcement. McEnany said that sections of the document were already out and different appendixes had to be discussed first.\n\"The 60-page document was merely an aggregation of a lot of what was already out there, so it\u2019s not as if this was new information that we were announcing, but it was more guidance pursuant to our \u2018reopening of America\u2019 guidance that was issued several weeks ago,\" McEnany said.\nThe CDC also said the guidelines are meant to be taken together with the White House\u2019s reopening guidance issued on April 17, 2020. But the White House version makes clear reopening decisions are up to state and local officials, while the CDC\u2019s version includes more details, such as recommendations to help businesses decide when to shut down in the case of future outbreaks.\nThe original plan also included instructions for faith-based organizations, which were stripped out of the final version.\nCNN reported that this section was one of the main holdups for publishing the CDC documents, because the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office for Civil Rights argued that faith-based organizations were being unfairly targeted. The department asked the CDC to ease social distancing recommendations for those groups, according to CNN, and encouraged federal health officials to let churchgoers congregate, saying that this aligned with the president\u2019s agenda.\nThe shelved CDC guide also recommended that nonessential travel should be avoided until the last phase of reopening, while the released version only mentions nonessential travel in relation to high-risk persons. The White House plan is looser on nonessential travel, too, and advises that communities \"minimize\" travel in Phase 1, and that in Phase 2, \"non-essential travel can resume.\"\nSome health experts and officials have criticized the delay, saying that detailed recommendations should have been available earlier.\n\"While it is not unusual for there to be White House review of forthcoming guidance, it is highly unusual for there to be a wholesale rewriting of guidelines at the request of the White House,\" said Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University.\n\"The holding back of recommendations regarding places of worship was particularly egregious given the high level of risk such indoor, mass gatherings can pose,\" Levi said. \"The shorter versions that were first released diminished their effectiveness, since they didn\u2019t provide as much detail as people needed to know how best to implement them. This delayed implementation of best practices \u2014 which could potentially have placed people at greater risk.\"\nBut the CDC told PolitiFact the report\u2019s revisions were part of a standard interagency process with the White House coronavirus task force.\n\"There is an iterative effort to ensure effective, clear guidance is presented to the American people,\" said Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC. \"As part of the Administration\u2019s whole of government approach to combating COVID-19, the CDC followed an inter-agency process of drafting considerations and submitting them to the White House Task Force for review and comment before posting the guidance for states to safely reopen.\"\nPolitiFact reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back.","cleaned_claim":"The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of re-opening should look like \u2014 the administration delayed and scaled them back.","ambiguity_score":0.1268073171,"paraphrases":[["The CDC developed guidelines about what the stages of re-opening should look like, but the administration delayed and scaled them back.",0.0638564825],["The CDC attempted to establish concise protocols regarding what the phases of reopening should entail; however, the administration stalled and diminished them instead.",0.0724353343],["The CDC attempted to establish concise protocols regarding what the re-opening process should entail; however, the administration delayed and lessened them.",0.0688538924],["The CDC attempted to create concise directives regarding what the phases of reopening should entail; however, the administration postponed and lessened them instead.",0.0768802911],["The CDC attempted to establish straightforward guidelines regarding what the phases of reopening should entail.

In reality, PolitiFact had not fact-checked those three topics at the time of the debate, and now that we have looked into them, we find support for Morrisey\u2019s position, not Jenkins\u2019.\nVoters tuning into the race for the first time could easily get the wrong impression about the accuracy of the attacks.\nWe rate the statement Half True.","full_article":"It\u2019s not every day that PolitiFact fact-checks are wielded as rhetorical weapons in U.S. Senate debates, but that\u2019s exactly what happened in a May 1 debate that pitted three Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in West Virginia.\nDuring the hotly contested campaign, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has regularly attacked one of his rivals, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, for a history of deviating from conservative orthodoxy.\nAs we\u2019ve previously noted, Jenkins was initially registered as a Democrat, then switched to Republican, then back to Democratic when he sought a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he became a Republican to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va.\nDuring the debate, Morrisey said, referring to Jenkins: \"I wasn\u2019t the one recruited by the liberal establishment because of his very questionable record. Once again, Obamacare support, cap and trade support, donating to Joe Manchin, holding a fundraiser at his house. That\u2019s not the West Virginia values we need to drain the swamp in Washington.\"\nTo rebut this attack, Jenkins pointed to a prior PolitiFact fact check.\n\"Unfortunately, Patrick Morrisey continues to spew his lies and misrepresentations,\" Jenkins said. \"We had PolitiFact, and all the things Patrick is saying \u2014 supporting Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood \u2014 PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, \u2018False, False, False, False.\u2019\"\nDid Jenkins cite our research correctly? He did, up to a point.\nRecapping our earlier fact-check\nThe congressman was referring to an article in which we checked a Morrisey statement that Jenkins \"has the same positions on the issues as Joe Manchin: supporting Hillary (Clinton), supporting cap-and-trade, supporting Planned Parenthood, many tax increases.\"\nHere\u2019s the rundown of the three issues Jenkins cited:\n\u2022 Support for Hillary Clinton. The Morrisey campaign had cited Jenkins\u2019 attendance at a July 27, 2007, economic policy town hall Clinton hosted at West Virginia State University. But that\u2019s not the same as a vote -- especially since Jenkins attended a similar event for President George W. Bush in 2004, when he was a Democrat.\nMorrisey\u2019s campaign also told us they believed Jenkins had voted for Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary in 2008 because he had stated he didn\u2019t support Obama but still voted. But Jenkins could have skipped voting for president on that ballot -- as his campaign says he did.\nAll told, there\u2019s no solid proof of Jenkins having voted for Clinton.\n\u2022 Support for cap-and-trade. Cap-and-trade legislation sets limits on emissions and then lets companies trade emission reduction credits. Carbon-emitting fuels like coals are at a disadvantage under such a system, making such laws unpopular in coal-heavy West Virginia.\nMorrisey\u2019s campaign said that in 1997, Jenkins sponsored HB 2476, a bill to create an emissions banking and trading program to incentivize better air quality. But Patrick McGinley and James Van Nostrand, two environmental law experts at West Virginia University familiar with the law, disagreed with that interpretation. They said the 1997 bill lacks a cap on emissions, the critical feature of cap-and-trade legislation.\n\u2022 Support for Planned Parenthood. Jenkins has cast repeated votes to defund Planned Parenthood due to its provision of abortion services, including the \"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,\" \"Defund Planned Parenthood Act\" and the \"Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\"\nFor our prior fact-check, the Morrisey campaign cited a 2006 Project Vote Smart survey on abortion in which Jenkins did not offer an opinion prohibiting public funding of abortions and to organizations that advocate or perform abortions. However, the Project Vote Smart website itself said that a lack of response did not indicate opposition to a policy. Jenkins did not respond to the most recent survey.\nNew wrinkles, and new attacks\nSo our previous fact-check provides significant support for Jenkins\u2019 claim. But there are some important holes to mention.\n\u2022 New evidence. Morrisey\u2019s campaign provided one new piece of evidence for the Planned Parenthood assertion that didn\u2019t exist when we wrote our first fact-check.\nThey noted that Jenkins voted for an omnibus spending bill on March 22, 2018. The bill doesn\u2019t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood. However, it keeps the longstanding status quo, under which the federal government pays for non-abortion-related services provided by Planned Parenthood through Medicaid and other programs. (We rated a similar claim from North Carolina Half True.)\n\u2022 Jenkins\u2019 language was too loose. Jenkins saying that PolitiFact had debunked \"all the things Patrick (Morrisey) is saying.\" In reality, three of the four specific items Morrisey cited in the preceding remark were ones the PolitiFact fact-check didn\u2019t address. (The one we previously did fact-check was Jenkins\u2019 support for cap-and-trade.)\nThe remaining three claims we hadn\u2019t yet checked were Jenkins\u2019 \"Obamacare support ... donating to Joe Manchin, (and) holding a fundraiser at his house\" for Manchin.\nOn these three issues, Morrisey has a point.\nIn 2011, Jenkins sponsored and voted for a bill to bring an Affordable Care Act health care exchange to West Virginia.\nMeanwhile, Jenkins donated $1,000 to Manchin\u2019s bid for governor on April 17, 2007, and another $1,000 on March 27, 2008.\nFinally, Jenkins hosted a fundraiser for Manchin at his home on March 27, 2008, that raised over $6,000.","cleaned_claim":"All the things Patrick Morrisey is saying \u2014 that I supported Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, Planned Parenthood \u2014 PolitiFact went through each and every allegation and said, \u2018False, False, False, False.\u2019","ambiguity_score":0.7838318944,"paraphrases":[["Patrick Morrisey is claiming that all the things being said about him are false, but PolitiFact has checked each one and found them to be false.",0.7838318944],["PolitiFact found that all of the claims made by Patrick Morrisey about the author's support for Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, and Planned Parenthood were false.",0.043107301],["Patrick Morrisey is claiming that everything he said is false, but PolitiFact says otherwise.",0.3925534189],["All of the things that Patrick Morrisey is saying I supported - such as Hillary Clinton, cap and trade, and Planned Parenthood - have been fact checked and found to be false.",0.0227742735],["Patrick Morrisey is claiming that everything he has said is false, but PolitiFact has found that to be untrue.",0.506909132]]}

Andrew Cuomo wants New York state to legalize recreational marijuana. Some state lawmakers, including Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, have long supported the idea. But there has been pushback to Cuomo\u2019s proposal. Assemblymember Patricia Fahy, a Democrat from the Albany area, favors starting with decriminalization but raises concerns about youth usage and driving under the influence, among other issues.\nFahy wrote an op-ed in the Times-Union of Albany and discussed her concerns in media interviews.\nIn an interview with radio host Susan Arbetter, Fahy questioned how much tax money New York state would collect if recreational marijuana became legal.\n\"Everybody thinks that this is going to be a massive money-maker,\" she said. \"There are projections of $200 to $400 million additional in New York state. We are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized. They\u2019re not meeting their targets for the most part.\"\nThe Cuomo administration predicts $300 million in tax revenue from the sale of recreational marijuana once legalization is fully phased in, according to budget materials. But is Fahy correct? Have other states missed their revenue targets?\nBackground\nTen other states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, though Vermont and DC do not allow commercial sales.\nAn assessment by New York State agencies on the effects of legalization, published in July 2018, warned that \"some states overestimated revenue initially, as they did not account for the length of time it takes for a recreational market to be established, leading to fewer than expected sales.\"\nWe asked Fahy\u2019s spokesman, Alexander Flood, for evidence of her claim. He pointed us to California, where the state collected less than it anticipated in the first full year of marijuana sales after a rocky rollout. He also referred us to reporting that showed that Colorado\u2019s revenues didn\u2019t meet expectations in the beginning.\n\"The complexity of the laws at the state level being rolled out has, in turn, complicated revenue projections for these states,\" Flood wrote in an email.\nWe looked at revenue results in states that have legalized commercial sales:\nIn Colorado, revenue predictions were reduced by the governor during the first year of sales. But revenues \"now greatly exceed original estimates of $70 million per year,\" according to a 2016 analysis from the Tax Foundation. Information from the Colorado Department of Revenue shows that marijuana tax revenues have increased steadily, and in fiscal year 2018, the state collected $263.8 million. \u00a0\u00a0\nIn Washington, retail sales began in July 2014, and from the start, tax receipts exceeded expectations, according to the state\u2019s Economic and Revenue Forecast. In fiscal year 2018, the state had brought in $367 million in cannabis license fees and taxes, up from $319 million in 2017, $189 million in 2016, and $65.7 million in 2015, according to annual reports from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board.\nIn California, legalization of recreational marijuana took effect in 2018. The state fell short of its estimates by $101 million during the first six months, according to a report from the state\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office.\u00a0A\u00a0rocky roll-out impeded growth in the legal market, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nIn Alaska, the first legal sales of recreational marijuana took place in fiscal year 2017, and collections of $1.7 million \"did not meet projections because licensing took longer than expected,\" according to the Alaska Department of Revenue. However, the story doesn\u2019t end there. \"After a slow start, this new industry has grown rapidly, and ... the marijuana tax is now generating over $1 million per month in revenue for the state,\" according to a state revenue report published in December 2018.\nIn Oregon, revenues from recreational marijuana have been \"substantially higher\" than estimates when the measure was on the ballot, according to Joshua Lehner, an economist with the state\u2019s Office of Economic Analysis.\nIn Nevada, the state brought in 140 percent of the revenue it expected during the first full year of legalization, according to the state\u2019s Department of Taxation.\nIn Massachusetts, recreational marijuana was approved by voters in 2016, but the state\u2019s first two retail stores did not open until November 2018.\nMaine is still working on its rules and regulations, and Michigan just legalized in November 2018.\nWhile many states have seen impressive growth in revenue, predicting future revenue may be complicated. States have a difficult time predicting usage, pricing and how legalization in nearby states affect tax revenues, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trusts and the Rockefeller Institute for Government, both nonpartisan organizations. However, researchers wrote that \"volatility in marijuana tax collections has been less of an issue and has primarily stemmed from seasonality.\"","cleaned_claim":"As for recreational marijuana revenue projections, we are seeing all those numbers reach disappointing levels in the states that have legalized.

Women earn 81.1 percent as much as men overall in the U.S. The bureau tracked full-time, year-round workers in 2015, the most recent numbers.\nOnly three other states and Washington, D.C., have smaller gaps. Women in Hawaii earn 87.9 percent as much as men, the highest level.\nResearch from the National Women\u2019s Law Center places New York state higher. The center compared data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the median salary of full-time, year-round male and female employees in each state from 2015.\u00a0The census estimates show women in New York state earn 88.7 percent as much as men \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 compared with 79.6 percent overall in the U.S.\n\"The data sample sizes are larger using the [Census Bureau] community survey, which is why we and other organizations use it,\" said Maya Raghu, NWLC Director of Workplace Equality.\nWhy New York state differs\nNew York has exceeded the national average in pay equity since at least 1998, the earliest federal data available online. Some years are better than others. New York state was less than one percentage point above the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 national average in 2005, when women earned 81 percent as much as men in the U.S.\nOther states consistently rank near the bottom for pay equity.\nWhy? Experts say no single reason explains it.\nOccupational segregation is one reason. The types of jobs women and men hold vary by state, Raghu said. North Dakota, where high-earning men dominate the oil industry,\u00a0ranks low for pay equity.\nNew York state\u2019s higher minimum wage also makes a difference. The minimum wage in New York was $8.75 in 2015, above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Having a higher pay floor reduces the gender wage gap for lower-income workers, experts say.\n\"In places like New York that have a higher minimum wage, you\u2019re going to see a smaller wage gap particularly at the lower end of the distribution,\" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.\nUnion membership also has an effect, Gould said.\nNew York state ranks higher in union membership than any other state in the country with a 23.6 percent union membership rate. Wyoming, which has the widest gender wage gap in the country, has a 6.3 percent union membership rate.\n\"Your unions may be very strong in New York, including teachers unions and unions that support service workers,\" said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution.\nNew York City also drives up the state\u2019s pay equity ranking. Data from the American Association of University Women breaks down the wage gap by congressional district in New York state. Most districts in New York City rank above those upstate.\n\"I think the rural urban divide is definitely part of the story,\" said Kevin Miller, a senior researcher at AAUW. \"Cities tend to have smaller gaps, which is why we see the District of Columbia having a small gap.\"\nEducation is part of that. More women in New York state hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, according to census data.\n\"The educational advantage is increasingly shifting toward women away from men, and in a technologically advancing economy that\u2019s going to favor toward women and raise their relative earnings,\" Sawhill said.\nThe family choices some women make during their careers also explain the wage gap.\nWomen are more likely to take time off work to care for a newborn child or a sick relative. A woman in that scenario may miss a significant chunk in pay during their leave from work. Without supplemental income during that time away from work, women are more likely to report lower pay than their male colleagues, experts say.","cleaned_claim":"We have pay equity.

Ted Cruz, said Sept. 29, 2018: \"In this state, with 30,000 kids in the foster care system \u2014a foster care system so under-resourced that recently kids were sleeping on top of or underneath the desks in CPS (Child Protective Services) offices\u2014in this state, they say that under the guise of religious liberty that you can be too gay to adopt one of those children who needs a loving home.\"\nWe wondered: Can a Texan be \"too gay\" to adopt a child in foster care?\nWhen we asked, Chris Evans of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign told us that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim was based on the Texas Legislature\u2019s action in 2017 known as House Bill 3859. The measure, signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, says that groups can decline to provide social services to a person if that person\u2019s beliefs conflict with the group\u2019s \"sincerely held religious beliefs.\" In this case, that would mean that a social service group that arranges adoptions could refuse to allow a gay couple to adopt a child through that group.\nCritics of the measure say that gay Texans are being refused adoption opportunities. Backers of the legislation and a state agency say the law does not keep any qualified adults, including gay residents, from adopting.\nWe read the law and noticed that it doesn\u2019t explicitly bar services to anyone based on sexual orientation, including adoption. The law says that if a group opts to decline service to someone, the group must direct the person to another service provider or to a state list of providers.\nOpponents of the proposal\u2014-including Equality Texas, which says it seeks to secure \"full equality\" for LGBTQ Texans\u2014maintain that the law hastens discrimination based on sexual orientation or other factors.\nIn Texas House debate on the measure in May 2017, the Texas Tribune reported, Democratic legislators warned that the plan would give groups license to discriminate against gay \u2014 or Jewish or divorced \u2014 parents who want to foster or adopt. A subsequent blog post by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ civil rights advocacy group, that said that under the law, state \"contractors who provide child welfare services can discriminate against qualified same-sex couples seeking to care for a child in need\u2014including LGBTQ couples, interfaith couples, single parents, married couples in which one prospective parent has previously been divorced, or other parents to whom the agency has a religious objection.\"\nAfter O'Rourke made his 2018 claim, we reached out to\u00a0Chuck Smith of Equality Texas. Smith indicated by email that Texas doesn\u2019t prohibit adoptions by same-sex couples. Still, he said, if \"you were to ask a provider like Catholic Charities if being just a little bit gay is OK with them, you\u2019d learn that they think that \u2018any gay\u2019 is \u2018too gay\u2019 when it comes to working with prospective adoptive parents.\" In that vein, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s statement was accurate, Smith said. \"For some licensed providers in Texas, including Catholic Charities, you can be too gay to adopt a foster child,\" Smith wrote.\nBy phone, Jennifer Allmon of the Texas Catholic Conference of Bishops offered a kind of confirmation, saying the conference helps married mothers and fathers adopt. \"Catholics believe fathers are men and mothers are women,\" Allmon said. Allmon also noted the law's requirement that anyone refused a service be referred to other providers.\nSmith said he\u2019s not aware of statistics or independent research on the extent to which the law \"has been used by certain providers to refuse to work with LGBTQ people.\"\nAdvocates say adoptions not prevented\nAdvocates of the law say it doesn\u2019t deter adoptions by gay Texans.\nState Rep. James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, who authored HB 3859, told us that nothing in the law \"would stop a same-sex couple from adopting or serving as foster parents in Texas.\" He added: \"There are existing providers today who place children in same-sex households.\"\nFranks was quoted in a May 2017 Associated Press news story speculating that different parents would choose different adoption paths. Frank said then that most adoptions happened through the state\u2019s child protective services agency, which would not be subject to the religious freedom mandate, though outside agencies that receive state funding would be. \"My guess is if you have an LGBT agency they\u2019re going to pick an LGBT family, and if you have a Baptist agency they may be more likely to pick a Baptist family,\" Frank told the AP. \"They\u2019re free to do that and should be free to do that.\"\nAllmon, who testified in favor of Frank\u2019s measure, suggested to us\u00a0that the law drove up adoptions. \"By allowing faithful engagement for those who are motivated to serve because of their religious convictions, the bill expands the diversity of competent providers and loving, stable families who can help the children of Texas,\" Allmon wrote. \"For example, the Texas Bishops launched a major parish based foster care recruitment and retention ministry, The St. Joseph Ministry, in March 2018. A bilingual parish toolkit has been sent to all 1,300 Catholic parishes in Texas to encourage parishes and parishioners to engage in the important work of serving those involved with the foster care system in Texas.\"\nState agency says gay adoptions not deterred\nA key state agency told us that, generally, a person\u2019s sexual orientation isn\u2019t considered in its placements of children in foster care.\nPatrick Crimmins of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, which oversees a website connecting adoptive parents with foster children awaiting adoption, said by email: \"While HB 3859 protects the religious beliefs of child-placing agencies and adoption agencies, that DOES NOT mean that a qualified individual cannot foster or adopt \u2013 it simply means that person should select an agency that will accept his or her application to foster or adopt.\"\nCrimmins said Texas has 133 foster\/adoption agencies, some with religious affiliations. \"The point is that there are plenty to choose from,\" Crimmins wrote.\nIn the 12 months through August 2018, Crimmins said, 5,636 children were adopted out of foster care statewide. As of September 2018, he said, 3,811 children in foster care needed an adoptive parent. Crimmins said the agency keeps no count of private adoptions.","cleaned_claim":"In Texas, you can be too gay to adopt a foster child who needs a loving home.","ambiguity_score":0.7591493726,"paraphrases":[["In Texas, you cannot adopt a foster child if you are considered to be too gay.",0.5546334982],["In Texas, you can be denied the right to adopt a foster child if you are gay.",0.0888998732],["In Texas, if you are gay, you cannot adopt a foster child who needs a loving home.",0.0850286037],["In Texas, you can be rejected as a foster parent if you are considered to be gay.",0.7591493726],["In Texas, if you are gay, you are not allowed to adopt a foster child who needs a loving home.",0.1490703523]]}

In fact, his campaign touted the Rauners\u2019 support of abortion rights groups to rebut the charge that he was not pro-choice.\nRauner sought anti-abortion voters by assuring them that, as governor, he had no social agenda and that \"the right for a woman to choose is the national law and... that ain\u2019t gonna change in Illinois.\" Politically, it proved to be a smart strategy that helped gain him election in 2014. By 2017, however, it became impossible to continue finessing the issue.\nIn picking a side, Rauner declared that he has been consistent in declaring his pro-choice beliefs. We rate that statement True.","full_article":"Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s signing of a controversial abortion bill last month triggered an avalanche of protest from his fellow Illinois Republicans and anti-abortion groups, who said he had betrayed them.\nThe bill, House Bill 40, removed a \"trigger provision\" in Illinois law that would have made abortion illegal should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe vs. Wade. It also made abortion eligible for coverage under Medicaid in Illinois and under the state\u2019s employee health insurance plan.\nOpponents were angry that Rauner broke a promise he made five months earlier to veto the bill because of its Medicaid and insurance component, which for the first time would use state taxpayer funds to pay for abortion outside of cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother. They also claimed Rauner reneged on a campaign pledge that he had \"no social agenda,\" which they interpreted as Rauner having no plans to change the state\u2019s abortion laws.\nIn a Sept. 28 press conference in which he announced his intent to sign the bill, Rauner lamented that he could not convince Democratic lawmakers to split the legislation into separate bills, one covering the trigger provision and the other dealing with insurance coverage. But he defended his action as consistent with his pro-choice principles.\n\"I personally am pro-choice. I always have been. And I made no qualms about that when I was elected governor,\" Rauner said.\nRauner\u2019s statement sent us combing through video clips, ads and news coverage of the 2014 gubernatorial election to see if he really was consistent in presenting his pro-choice stance to voters during that hotly contested race. Here\u2019s what we found.\nPlain talk\nRauner, a wealthy private equity investor who had never run for elected office, sought to build his campaign solely on economic, educational and political reform issues. He stated often that he had no social agenda, and his wife, Diana, appeared in a campaign ad making that very statement.\nThis helped Rauner avoid taking a direct stand on same-sex marriage, which was a hot topic in Illinois politics in the months preceding the 2014 GOP primary for governor. In May 2013, just before Rauner formally declared his candidacy, longtime state GOP chairman Pat Brady resigned in part because of fallout from him having declared his support for same-sex marriage.\nRauner\u2019s no-social-agenda claim also proved useful when it came to navigating the political minefield of abortion. To win election in a Democratic-leaning state, Rauner needed to get votes from Democrats who support abortion rights and moderate Republicans without antagonizing social conservatives.\n\"My opponent is desperate for social issues to become prominent in the campaign,\" Rauner said in a campaign appearance with his running mate, Evelyn Sanguinetti, in June 2014. \"And I\u2019ve been crystal clear: I do not have a social agenda. Evelyn and I are not running on social issues. We all have our personal beliefs. We are not advocating leading on social issues, we are fine with the status quo on that.\"\nThat said, we found several examples in which Rauner explained his position on access to abortion during the campaign.\nIn an appearance before Wauconda Township Republicans on Oct. 2, 2013, Rauner said:\n\"Abortion is a tragedy. It\u2019s a loss of life. To me that\u2019s not debatable. However, I do not advocate making it illegal. I can\u2019t, I won\u2019t, I\u2019m not going to talk about making it illegal. I\u2019m going to work and support efforts to make it safe and rare. Parental notification, late-term restrictions, teaching abstinence outside of marriage and strongly encouraging adoption as a far better alternative.\"\nTo residents of HeatherRidge community in Gurnee on Nov. 3, 2013:\n\"The reality is the right for a woman to choose is the national law and we\u2019re not gonna, that ain\u2019t gonna change in Illinois. I think we can agree on some common-sense ways where abortion can be more rare and safe. I support parental notification. I support late-term restrictions. I strongly encourage adoption as a far better alternative to abortion. There are things we can agree on to work on to try and get done, realistically\u2026\n\"I just think it\u2019s better for a woman and her physician and her family and her minister or priest make the decision than the government. That\u2019s my view. People can disagree with me. I respect that. But that\u2019s my view, it ain\u2019t gonna change.\"\nIt came up in an interview on the \"Big John and Amy Show\" on WIND-AM 560 on March 17, 2014:\nAmy Jacobson: \"If there was a possibility that the decision was passed from federal to state jurisdiction, what would your position be?\"\nRauner: \"My position would be abortion is a tragedy but it should be an issue left to a woman with her physician and her family and her minister, not the government.\"\nDiana\u2019s role\nIt wasn\u2019t just the candidate himself proclaiming his \"pro-choice\" bona fides during the campaign. Diana Rauner, head of the child advocacy concern the Ounce of Prevention Fund, became a strong spokeswoman for her husband\u2019s no-social-agenda agenda, especially where it concerned reproductive rights.\n\"You can trust him that there\u2019s no way he will ever let anything happen to our reproductive rights,\" Diana Rauner said in an interview with NBC5 political reporter Mary Ann Ahern on Sept. 26, 2014. \"I actually think this is a great opportunity in this race where we actually don\u2019t have to think about the social issues because both candidates are pro-choice.\"\nThe campaign featured a 30-second TV ad in which Diana, who claimed to be a Democrat, \u00a0sought to bring Democrats to her husband\u2019s side by telling viewers, \"Bruce doesn't have a social agenda. He has an economic and educational agenda.\"\nAfter an Oct. 24, 2014, event in Chicago in which feminist icon Gloria Steinem endorsed Quinn and accused Rauner of financially supporting anti-abortion causes and candidates. \"In terms of money and action, he is, in fact, anti-choice,\" Steinem said during her appearance with Quinn.\nDiana Rauner provided the response in an interview with then ABC-7 political reporter Charles Thomas.\n\"Bruce has a strong history of being a supporter of reproductive rights,\" she said. \"He\u2019s a social moderate and he\u2019s committed to education and has shown that commitment over the years.\"\nOpposition message\nThroughout the campaign, Rauner found himself in the strange position of being a Republican candidate forced to deny charges that he opposed abortion. Despite Rauner\u2019s many statements to the contrary, the Quinn campaign sought to portray Rauner as a major funder of anti-abortion candidates and organizations.\nThe Chicago Tribune story on Steinem\u2019s appearance carried this rebuttal from Rauner\u2019s campaign: \"Rauner campaign aides said the candidate and wife Diana have donated money to abortion rights groups including Planned Parenthood and the Roger Baldwin Foundation.\" The Baldwin Foundation is a branch of the American Civil Liberties Union that litigates issues including reproductive rights.\nAt the same time, however, Rauner was a heavy donor to Republican candidates and state and national Republican organizations that were firmly in the anti-abortion camp. Chicago Magazine detailed the political\/ideological conflict of the Rauners in an article published the day before the 2014 election headlined, \"Is Bruce Rauner Pro-Choice, Anti-Choice, or Just an Opportunist?\"\n(I)t\u2019s interesting to look at the self-proclaimed Democrat, Diana, who has given in 2014 the max in the primary and\/or general to several Republicans, some who are decidedly not socially moderate...\n\nJust a couple of examples: David McSweeney (abortion and gay marriage opponent), Mark Neerhof (against gay marriage). Diana has also given generously ($10,000 in 2012; $5,300 this time around) to the Republican Renaissance PAC of the late ultra-conservative Jack Roeser (anti abortion, anti gay marriage).\n\nBruce has a much more extensive record of contributions\u2014including $27.6 million to himself, $5 million to the state Republican party, and also, along with Diana, donations to McSweeney, Neerhof, and to Roeser\u2019s PAC. (Roeser, who died last June, was an early Rauner backer and a member of his gubernatorial exploratory committee.)\nConsidering the contradictory nature of the Rauners\u2019 donations -- giving heavily to groups that support abortion rights and also to political candidates and organizations that oppose them -- it\u2019s reasonable to believe that some anti-abortion voters might have inferred anti-abortion leanings in candidate Rauner. But we found no evidence of Rauner himself attempting to hide his true stance.\nNo status quo\nIn 2014, campaigning on maintaining the status quo on abortion was a viable option. State finances were a wreck and there appeared to be little pressure either way to change the state\u2019s laws on abortion.\nThe election of Donald Trump, who stated an intent to overturn Roe v. Wade and turn the question of abortion\u2019s legality back to the states, changed that overnight.\nAlmost immediately, Democrats in the Illinois General Assembly began advancing a bill to both keep abortion legal should Roe v. Wade be overturned and provide insurance coverage for it under Medicaid and Illinois\u2019 state employee health insurance.\n\"I look at it as an insurance parity issue. There\u2019s no excuse about the cost,\" Rep. Sara Feigenholtz, D-Chicago, said in December 2016.\nBy packaging the trigger language and the expanded insurance coverage into a single bill, supporters of what became HB 40 effectively boxed Rauner by forcing the no-social-agenda governor to pick a side in the culture wars.\nHe would infuriate pro-choice voters by either vetoing the bill outright or issuing an amendatory veto to strike the abortion insurance provision, the practical effect of which would be to kill the measure anyway. But signing HB 40 would be sure to antagonize much his Republican base, much of which remains passionately opposed to abortion.\nThis was something Rauner had worked throughout the spring to avoid, at times sending out mixed signals about how he intended to handle the bill if lawmakers sent it to his desk. He made public statements in April promising to veto the bill as written. When he broke that promise, he faced the wrath of everyone from rank-and-file Republican lawmakers to Chicago Cardinal Blaise Cupich.\nRauner, speaking haltingly and appearing physically uncomfortable, explained at his signing press conference that adding government funded insurance coverage was consistent with his pro-choice beliefs.\n\"I also believe that no woman should be forced to make a different decision than another woman make purely based on her income,\" Rauner said. \"I believe that a woman living with limited financial means should not be put in a position where she has to choose something different than a woman of higher income would be able to choose.\"","cleaned_claim":"I personally am pro-choice.

Fox News\u2019 coverage was fleeting before Kelly\u2019s interview was announced.\nWe rate his claim True.","full_article":"It\u2019s been a big week for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, chosen by the famous Duggar family of TLC\u2019s 19 Kids and Counting to exclusively air their side of the story involving the oldest Duggar son molesting five minors, including his sisters, a decade ago.\nBut to some observers, Fox\u2019s intense promotion of Kelly\u2019s June 3 interview with parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and her later sit-down with two daughters molested by Josh Duggar marked a drastic shift in the network\u2019s coverage of the story.\n\"It\u2019s slightly amusing that Fox News barely covered this scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview,\" said CNN senior media correspondent and Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter on June 2. \"Now they\u2019ll be covering it a lot more.\"\nWe wanted to double-check Stelter\u2019s analysis. Was Fox News essentially mum about the story until Kelly scored the at-home exclusive?\nStelter told PunditFact that he first started thinking about the coverage disparity when he saw a story by liberal site Media Matters for America that compared light coverage by Fox with intensive coverage by MSNBC and CNN. He and CNNMoney media reporter Tom Kludt did their own research and reached a similar conclusion for a story about the interview.\n\"Along with the amount of time spent, we took into account the type of Fox's coverage,\" Stelter said. \"Early on, the mentions of the controversy were fleeting, not substantive at all.\"\nThe controversy went public when In Touch Weekly published the first story May 19 about Josh Duggar being the suspect in a 2005 underage sexual abuse investigation. In Touch and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published more stories May 21 based on a police report that said the father did not go to law enforcement until a year after the fondling incidents took place.\nAfter the stories appeared, Josh Duggar resigned his position as executive director of the Family Research Council and apologized in a statement, saying, \"Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation.\"\nTLC pulled all episodes of 19 Kids and Counting the next day, May 22.\nFox first told its viewers about the situation in a 30-second segment on May 22, followed by a \u00a020-second segment on May 23. On May 26, the Duggars were mentioned on The Five in the context of Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee defending the family. \"You don\u2019t go around defending the Duggar family when you\u2019ve got bigger issues going on,\" said pundit Greg Gutfeld. \u00a0Fox analyst Howard Kurtz criticized the media\u2019s focus on the Duggar family in a May 24 segment.\nThose are the only references we could find before May 30, when Kelly\u2019s interview was announced.\nNeedless to say, those mentions of the story were super-brief \u2014 especially when you compare how the other networks handled it. CNN and MSNBC anchors devoted considerably more time to the controversy from the start.\nWe used Critical Mention, which searches closed-captioning transcripts, to look for mentions of the Duggars on the three networks from May 19 to noon on May 30, roughly when the interview was announced. This method isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 misspellings aren\u2019t captured, for instance \u2014 but it does provide a rough snapshot of how often each network discussed the family.\nFox News personalities mentioned \"Duggar\" four times. Within the same timeframe, the family name came up 99 times on CNN and 72 times on MSNBC.\nOn Stelter\u2019s home network of CNN, the story was brought up on five different shows on May 22, with Erin Burnett OutFront and Anderson Cooper 360 devoting substantial chunks of air time to interviews with an In Touch staffer and child psychiatry professionals, as well as going into other TLC shows with stars that fell from grace. CNN Tonight host Don Lemon continued to explore the story in his May 26-28 shows.\nOn MSNBC, nearly every show on May 22 talked about the story, including hosts Alex Wagner, Ed Schultz, Al Sharpton and Chris Hayes, often bringing in experts to dissect some of the story\u2019s finer points. The network continued to cover the story on May 26, 27 and 28.\nFox began to report the story in more depth on June 1, when Kelly criticized the media\u2019s handling of the story with Fox media analyst Howard Kurtz. She equated the rush to cover the story as feasting on a carcass, going after CNN specifically for bringing up how GOP presidential candidates had taken pictures with Josh Duggar before the scandal broke.\nKelly\u2019s coverage of the story has also focused on the release of police records, which she and the Duggars say should have never been made public.\nOther shows on the network, including The O\u2019Reilly Factor, Outnumbered, Your World and Fox and Friends, started talking about the Duggars in the context of Kelly\u2019s interview. From noon on May 30 to about 5 p.m. on\u00a0June 5, there have been 134 mentions of \"Duggar\" on Fox, according to Critical Mention.\nFox News spokespersons did not offer comment for the story.","cleaned_claim":"Fox News barely covered the Duggar family scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure this interview.","ambiguity_score":0.6339049935,"paraphrases":[["Fox News did not give much coverage to the Duggar family scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure an interview with them.",0.1947513074],["Fox News didn't cover the Duggar family scandal much until Megyn Kelly was able to get an interview with them.",0.142070815],["Fox News barely covered the scandal involving the Duggar family until Megyn Kelly was able to secure an interview with them.",0.2794601917],["Fox News barely covered the Duggar family scandal until Megyn Kelly was able to secure an interview with them.",0.6339049935],["Fox News didn't give the Duggar family scandal much attention until Megyn Kelly got an interview with them.",0.0475920103]]}

But his claim inflates the scope of the problem].\nHe took a broad finding about the number of people who had experienced an insurance gap for any reason roughly five years ago and misleadingly used it to describe a much narrower segment of the current population who lost insurance because of employment changes.\nThe claim has an element of truth but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False.","full_article":"The moderators kicked off the third Democratic debate with health care, teeing up another round of the ongoing \"Medicare for All\" debate.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders caught our attention by claiming that 50 million people lose their private insurance every year due to employment changes.\n\"George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy,\" Sanders said.\nThat sounds like a huge number even before he qualified it by attributing it to job loss and other work-related occasions for an insurance lapse.\nWe reached out to the Sanders\u2019 campaign to find out the basis for this claim, and they pointed to an analysis by the People\u2019s Policy Project, a social democratic-leaning think-tank. That analysis hinges on a question asked as part of a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey in 2014, plus a little basic multiplication.\nThe survey asked adults between the ages of 18 and 64, in 43 states: \"In the PAST 12 MONTHS was there any time when you did NOT have ANY health insurance or coverage?\" In response, 12.9% said they had experienced a gap in coverage, while 11.5% said they had been uninsured for more than 12 months.\nThe think-tank analysis then combined those percentages and multiplied them by current population estimates, coming up with \"just under 50 million people\" who were uninsured for at least part of the year. (It went on to endorse \"Medicare for All.\")\nThis claim becomes perplexing when you consider the total number of uninsured people in recent years. In 2013, there were more than 44 million uninsured, non-elderly Americans in total. With the initial implementation of the Affordable Care Act, that number steadily declined until last year when it ticked up slightly to 27.5 million.\nA Sanders spokeswoman also cited another People\u2019s Policy Project blog post analyzing the number of people who leave their jobs (66.1 million in 2018, it said) and government data on the number of jobs the average worker has had by age 50 (11.9).\nThe campaign specifically pointed to this sentence in the blog post: \"This labor turnover data leaves little doubt that people with employer-sponsored insurance are losing that insurance constantly, as are their spouses and kids.\"\nThe CDC data is compelling, to be sure \u2014 but Sanders did not accurately portray what it said on the debate stage, nor did he accurately portray the policy analysis his campaign claimed was his source.\nSanders appears to suggest that one-third of those with private insurance are uninsured for at least a short time every year because of a change to their employment benefits.\nIn actuality, the CDC data show that about 24.4% of non-elderly adults in 2014 had experienced at least a gap in insurance coverage in the previous year. The question did not ask respondents to specify the cause.\nThe age of the report also poses a challenge: The Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion began in 2014, and the report surveyed just 23 Medicaid expansion states at the time. Today, 37 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, suggesting the number of people with insurance gaps on an annual basis could have dropped.\nAnd the People\u2019s Policy Project analysis actually refers broadly to 50 million non-elderly Americans who were uninsured, temporarily or otherwise -- it doesn\u2019t say those people were uninsured because their job situation changed.","cleaned_claim":"Was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy.","ambiguity_score":0.5199884176,"paraphrases":[["Was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they become unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy.",0.009233227],["About 150 million people in the US have private health insurance.

In some ways, Nevada\u2019s law would be tougher, but in other ways it would not. Overall, California would have more regulations on firearm transfers if Question 1 passes but would be more lenient in exempting certain types of gun transfers.\nUithoven\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/58d554fc-0594-4176-8f93-379390f58bf5","full_article":"Two major players in the debate over gun laws are bringing the fight to Nevada, where voters will decide in November on requiring universal background checks on the sale or transfer of firearms.\nBoth the National Rifle Association and Everytown for Gun Safety are dumping millions of dollars into the state in the battle over Question 1.\nVeteran state Republican operative Robert Uithoven is leading efforts to defeat the measure, and recently criticized the initiative on a public-affairs television program and warned that passing the measure would make Nevada gun laws even more restrictive than its more liberal neighbor \u2014 California.\n\"If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California,\" he said in a June 6 interview on Nevada NewsMakers.\nThe California\/Nevada comparison is becoming a more popular talking point among opponents of the ballot measure, but would Question 1 actually make Nevada stricter than California on gun transfers? The answer isn\u2019t so clear.\nWhat\u2019s at stake?\nSo what would Nevada\u2019s proposed background check expansion actually mean for gun owners?\nIf approved by voters, the initiative would create an escalating penalty (starting with a misdemeanor) for people without a license to sell firearms to sell or transfer guns without first going to a licensed dealer and having them conduct a background check.\nThat would be a departure from current state law, where background checks are generally not required for gun sales or transfers between two private parties (lawmakers approved a change waiving fees for voluntary background checks in 2015).\nRepublican Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have enacted a similar background check process on private gun sales and transfers, saying it would impose \"unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties\" on otherwise law-abiding gun owners.\nIf approved, licensed firearm dealers would be required to conduct the background checks, which is done under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and is generally completed fairly quickly (though delays can last up to three days).\nThere are some exceptions built in to the ballot question, including sales and transfers between family members and for antique guns. Temporary transfers without background checks would be allowed in some specific cases, like on certified shooting ranges, in areas where it\u2019s legal to hunt or while in the presence of the gun owner.\nDebate over the ballot measure echoes the national debate over gun control. Supporters say the majority of background checks are completed quickly and the measure closes an existing loophole, while opponents lambast the measure for being overly vague and unduly burdensome on gun owners.\nTransfers and Exemptions\nApproval of Question 1 would turn private party gun sales and transfers in Nevada into a process that would more closely resemble California\u2019s existing system, but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers, or loans.\nUithoven told PolitiFact that California generally allows people \"who are personally known to each other\" to infrequently loan firearms for up to 30 days as long as the recipient has a valid firearm safety certificate and the loan is for a \"lawful purpose.\"\nCalifornia also has exemptions for transfers as gifts, on gun ranges, for use as props in the entertainment industry, loans to minors under certain requirements and for licensed hunters during hunting season(though California lawmakers are debating rolling back several of the exemptions including the 30-day infrequent loans).\nBecause the Nevada ballot measure don\u2019t allow for a \"temporary\" transfer, or loan, between friends unless the gun owner is in the physical presence of the person handling the gun or under a several clearly stated, well-defined situations (like on a shooting range or legal hunting area), Uithoven says the new law would be stricter than what California requires.\nThe ballot measure does have a broader definition of \"immediate family member,\" as California only includes transfers between parents, children, and grandparents as exempt from transfer regulations. Question 1 broadens those family exemptions in Nevada and includes \"parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.\"\nSo California is stricter on which family members fall under the inter-family gun transfers label, but as Uithoven points out, the state does have an easier process for \"infrequent\" firearms loans (less than six times per calendar year) to people who are \"personally known to each other,\" which could include friends or other family members.\nBut those \"infrequent transfers\" still require firearm transferees to have completed the state\u2019s Firearm Safety Certificate course, which is a $25 written test on firearm safety and general gun laws.\nThat\u2019s a regulatory hurdle that doesn\u2019t exist in Nevada, with or without the ballot measure.\nAs for any other non-familial transfers that don\u2019t fall under exemptions, California is generally stricter than a post-Question 1 Nevada. So-called \"private party transfers\" in California require a proof-of-residency requirement, a safe handling demonstration requirement and a mandatory ten-day waiting period, whereas the Nevada proposal would only require passing a background check.\nUithoven also says that the ballot measure allows licensed firearms dealers to ask for an undefined \"reasonable fee\" to conduct the background check, while California has a set dollar amount written into the state\u2019s penal code.\nWe also reached out to the pro-Question 1 Background Checks Initiative, who highlighted a handful of California regulations that Nevada would lack.\nCalifornia also has an \"assault weapons\" ban, which includes a ban on private sales or transfers of so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Nevada has no such ban.\nThe state has several additional regulations on private party gun sales compared to the proposed Nevada changes, but not all of them directly relate to firearm transfer rules.\nCalifornia generally requires a 10-day waiting period for any gun sale or transfer, including private party sales and transfers (though it\u2019s being challenged in court). Again, this regulation doesn\u2019t apply to the exempted transfers.\nCalifornia also prohibits buyers from purchasing more than one handgun in a 30-day period, but that\u2019s only for retail sales \u2014 private party transfers are exempt.","cleaned_claim":"If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California.","ambiguity_score":0.0552049167,"paraphrases":[["If Question 1 passes in Nevada, it would mean that gun transfer laws would be more restrictive than they are in California.",0.0239056982],["If Question 1 passes in Nevada, the state will have stricter gun laws regarding the transfer of firearms than California.",0.0552049167]]}

Leonidas Raptakis, D-Coventry, wants to know: What is the meaning of life?\nAt least when it comes to sentencing someone to prison.\nThat\u2019s because in Rhode Island, as in many other states, there are two types of life sentences. There is life without parole, which is levied after a special hearing held by the judge in the case after the initial trial.\nAnd there is a life sentence that allows inmates to seek parole after serving a certain number of years, depending on the crime.\nRaptakis is pressing for a bill in the current General Assembly session that would make inmates who are serving a life sentence for first-degree murder wait 30 years before being eligible for parole, instead of the current 20.\nAt the Feb. 11 news conference where he unveiled his proposed legislation, Raptakis argued that Rhode Island\u2019s 20-year wait is lenient compared with other Northeastern states -- the \"bottom of the barrel,\" he said. Later, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, he said Rhode Island was \"dead last\" among the states in the northeastern United States.\nSo, are Rhode Island\u2019s laws on parole eligibility guilty as charged?\nAt his news conference, Raptakis handed out a map listing the first-degree murder penalties in 12 states, from Virginia to Maine, and the District of Columbia. (Technically, not all of the states he mentioned are considered Northeastern by the Census Bureau, although they are included in other definitions of the region.)\nRaptakis said he got his information from Wikipedia.\nTo check, we went to the websites of each of the 12 states and the District of Columbia and read their criminal statutes for life sentences for first-degree murder.\nOnly Rhode Island and Virginia allowed first-degree murderers to seek parole after 20 years.\nIn Connecticut, Maine and New York, they become eligible after 25 years. In New Jersey and the District of Columbia, they are eligible after 30 years, in Vermont after 35.\nIn five other states -- Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Hampshire -- first-degree murderers are not eligible for parole.","cleaned_claim":"Rhode Island is almost dead last among Northeastern states in the length of time first-degree murderers must spend in prison before they\u2019re eligible for parole.","ambiguity_score":0.747682631,"paraphrases":[["Rhode Island has some of the shortest prison sentences for first-degree murderers in the Northeastern United States, which may make them eligible for parole sooner.",0.4630061388],["Rhode Island is one of the worst states in the Northeast when it comes to how long first-degree murderers have to spend in prison before they are eligible for parole.",0.0690656826],["Rhode Island is one of the states in the Northeast where murderers must spend the longest time in prison before being eligible for parole.",0.5743795037],["Rhode Island has some of the shortest prison sentences for first-degree murderers of any Northeastern state.",0.747682631],["Rhode Island is one of the states in the Northeast where first-degree murderers must spend the least amount of time in prison before they are eligible for parole.",0.6193029881]]}

Andrew Cuomo on Twitter.\nIn a May 7 tweet, Parlato shared a video she had made as part of her \"Table Talk\" series. In it, she spotlighted comments Cuomo had made about education during a May 5 press conference.\nAccording to Parlato, Cuomo \"said gone are the days when we have one classroom with a teacher in the front. With all the technology we have, we don't need actual classrooms. He said we have the internet to teach our kids.\"\nParlato, a lawyer and former judge, is running in the Republican primary for a seat in the suburbs of Buffalo and Rochester that was vacated in 2019 by Republican Chris Collins.\nDid Cuomo say what Parlato said he did? He said something close. But Parlato exaggerated some of his comments, and Cuomo later amended them.\nWhat did Cuomo say in his May 5 press conference?\nDuring Cuomo\u2019s May 5 daily press briefing, he addressed the effect the coronavirus pandemic was having on traditional education methods.\n\"The old model of everybody goes and sits in the classroom and the teacher is in front of that classroom and teaches that class and you do that all across the city, all across the state, all these buildings, all these physical classrooms \u2014 why, with all the technology you have?\"\nCuomo said the internet has changed education and that traditional teaching practices may need to be reevaluated, especially considering how unprepared many districts were for online learning.\nCuomo spoke about working with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to \"reimagine\" education in New York state given the need for online learning during the pandemic. (Parlato also mentioned this in her video.)\nAnd on May 6, Cuomo asked Google\u2019s former CEO, Eric Schmidt, to help lead a new commission to redesign the state\u2019s educational systems.\nSo Parlato had a point that Cuomo was envisioning a future in which brick-and-mortar classrooms were less important. But she exaggerated somewhat. Cuomo didn\u2019t explicitly say he wanted to rule out traditional learning tactics or that \"we don\u2019t need actual classrooms.\"\nIn fact, Cuomo talked about reopening schools in New York state once the pandemic has subsided enough to ensure safety.\n\"It\u2019s not about just reopening schools,\" Cuomo said in the May 5 press conference. \"When we are reopening schools, let\u2019s open a better school and let\u2019s open a smarter education system.\"\nCuomo altered his stance after pushback\nCuomo\u2019s May 5 comments sparked a backlash from teachers, students and parents, with many interpreting Cuomo\u2019s message in the same way Parlato did. And in the weeks after Parlato sent her tweet, Cuomo backed off his comments.\n\"\u2018Reimagine education\u2019 means let's go through, let's look at what happened,\" Cuomo said on May 20. \"What can we learn that\u2019s positive? I would agree with the teachers who say, \u2018There is no substitute for classroom teaching.\u2019 There is no substitute.\"\nInstead, he said, \"what happened to us here was you couldn\u2019t do the classroom experience, because of the coronavirus, etc., so you have to go to remote learning. I don\u2019t believe every school district was ready for this abrupt shift to remote learning. And how could they be? Nobody was ready for this abrupt shift of this coronavirus.\"\nCuomo\u2019s office confirmed statements made at his May 5 and May 20 press conferences and didn\u2019t comment further on Parlato\u2019s video.","cleaned_claim":"Said New York Gov.

And records show the contributions to Ives total $6,900, a far cry from the $2.5 million she has received from a conservative businessman who once was a major donor to Rauner.\nIves was once a loyal supporter of Rauner in the Illinois House, but broke with the governor last year because she claimed he had become too liberal on social issues. Central to her complaint was Rauner\u2019s signing of abortion rights and immigrant rights legislation that Ives opposed and Madigan backed.\nThat is hardly a portrait of a Madigan lackey. Indeed, it is the opposite.\nRauner campaign claims about Ives and Madigan turn credibility and rational argument inside out. That is why we give them our lowest possible credibility rating, Pants On Fire!","full_article":"As governor, Republican Bruce Rauner has waged a ceaseless battle with Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan. But in seeking re-election, Rauner also is fighting off a primary challenge from state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton, one of the most conservative Republicans in the House.\nThe deep-pocketed Rauner is now seeking to combine his two political enemies into one by portraying Ives as a Madigan stooge in TV ads. One ad intersperses clips of Ives speaking about Madigan with an announcer leveling damning accusations.\n\"Who\u2019s really behind Jeanne Ives\u2019 campaign for governor?\" the announcer asks ominously. \"Mike Madigan\u2019s corrupt insider machine. They\u2019ve bankrolled her campaign with thousands in shady labor union cash, turning Ives into another Madigan lackey. Jeanne Ives, she can\u2019t serve you because she already serves him.\"\nHyperbole and exaggeration are commonplace in political ads, but this one struck us as not just over the top but ridiculous. Ives is the ideological opposite of Madigan and his Democrats.\nHow then could she be doing his bidding, as Rauner\u2019s campaign asserts? We decided to take a closer look.\nUnion\u2019s cash, ideologue\u2019s bounty\nWe asked Rauner\u2019s campaign to explain how it linked Ives to Madigan, and spokesman Justin Giorgio pointed to $6,900 in political cash Ives has received from a political action committee of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 in Countryside. The union represents heavy equipment operators and mechanics and industrial machinery operators.\nIn an email, Giorgio described Local 150 as a \"Madigan-aligned labor group.\"\nBut Marc Poulos, executive director of the PAC, said it has donated to Democrats and Republicans alike who support road building and other construction projects. Ives, he noted, backed a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2016 that barred state officials from diverting transportation related tax revenue for other purposes. The group contributed most of its money to Ives before she announced her run for governor.\nSince 2010, the union PAC has given $13.9 million to Democrats and Republicans, state records show. Four political committees controlled by Madigan, including the Democratic Party of Illinois, have received more than $1 million from the labor group. But Republican legislative leaders, as well as rank-and-file GOP lawmakers like Ives, also received money.\nState records show that since 2010, the Local 150 PAC has showered $45,000 in campaign cash on current state Senate Republican leader Bill Brady of Bloomington, who is backing Rauner in the primary. Brady recorded receiving $5,000 of that as recently as March 1 at a time the Rauner attack ad on Ives was already airing.\nAnother $32,000 in Local 150-connected donations have also been directed to Senate Republican caucus whip Karen McConnaughay of St. Charles.\nMeanwhile, House Republican leader Jim Durkin has been the recipient of $170,500 in Local 150 PAC donations since 2010, though the money flow has stopped in the current election cycle when the union broke with Durkin and began actively trying to defeat him.\nRauner, however, has received no donations from the Local 150 PAC, records show.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that Rauner\u2019s campaign hangs its argument about Ives and Madigan on a tiny sliver of her political financing while making no mention of her main source of funding, Lake Forest businessman Richard Uihlein.\nUihlein is the wealthy owner of a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company and a major donor to an array of causes and candidates attractive to the far right of the Republican Party, including the failed Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.\nRecords show Uihlein has donated $2.5 million to the Ives campaign for governor, about 70 percent of all money she\u2019s raised since announcing her candidacy in December.\nFour years ago, Uihlein donated $2.6 million to Rauner for his initial run for governor.\nAlso included in the Rauner campaign ad are video snippets of comments Ives made during a debate with Rauner earlier this year before the Chicago Tribune editorial board.\nAt one point, she can be heard chastising Rauner for \"picking on Mike Madigan again.\" At another point, Ives reacts to a Rauner comment about Madigan by saying, \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any way to deal with the powerful speaker of the house, Mike Madigan.\"\nThe context of her comments was far different from what the cherry-picked segments used in the Rauner campaign ad make them appear. The full video of the debate makes it clear Ives was not defending Madigan but rather criticizing Rauner for what she claimed was his ineffectiveness in working with and negotiating with the Democratic majority in the Legislature.","cleaned_claim":"Who\u2019s really behind Jeanne Ives\u2019 campaign for governor?

Dan Forest, a Republican who\u2019s running against Cooper, says kids should be allowed to go to school. Currently, students in kindergarten through 12th grade are only allowed to attend in-person classes in some counties \u2014 and only at a reduced capacity.\nIn an interview posted Sept. 2, Forest said Cooper\u2019s restrictions on in-person learning aren\u2019t necessary.\n\"There\u2019s no evidence anywhere in the world that our kids should not be in schools. There\u2019s no evidence of that anywhere. All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus,\" he said.\nIs it true that children are \"17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?\"\nForest has repeated similar claims at other events.\nWhat Forest said\nWe asked Forest\u2019s campaign where he was getting his information. Forest spokesman Andrew Dunn pointed to a recent editorial from the Wall Street Journal.\nCiting analysis from The Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a think tank, the Journal wrote:\n\"Fatality rate comparisons between Covid-19 and the flu are inapt because they affect populations differently. Children under age 14 are between 6.8 and 17 times less likely to die of Covid-19 than the seasonal flu or pneumonia, assuming 150,000 coronavirus deaths this year.\"\nEven if the Wall Street Journal\u2019s description of the study is accurate, Forest isn\u2019t representing it correctly.\nFirst, Forest ignores the paper\u2019s disclaimer that comparisons between COVID-19 and the flu are \"inapt because they affect populations differently.\" Then, he misrepresented the math.\nThe WSJ reported a mathematical range: \"between 6.8 and 17 times.\" Forest cherry-picked the top of that range and has stated it as if it is an accepted fact.\nThen, Forest misquoted the study. The Journal mentioned deaths, and Forest has repeatedly said \"ill effects.\" By doing this, Forest downplays the risk to children.\nCoronavirus and kids\nThe flu appears to be more of a serious threat to children than the novel coronavirus, as PolitiFact reported in August and September. But the CDC hasn\u2019t said how much higher the risk is for the flu.\nAnd the CDC\u2019s website distinguishes between healthy children and those with pre-existing conditions.\nFor healthy children, the risk of complications \"is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,\" the CDC said. Meanwhile, kids with underlying medical conditions \"are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19.\"\nThe term \"ill effects\" is squishy and vague. Let\u2019s look at how many children have been hospitalized by the two illnesses. (PolitiFact Wisconsin reported these figures in its Sept. 8 fact-check of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson.)\nDuring the 2018-19 flu season, the hospitalization rate among children 5 to 17 was 39.2 children per 100,000 children.\nFor COVID-19 patients in that age group, the CDC says the hospitalization rate is 6 per 100,000 children. (For those interested in the math: 39 is 6.5 times higher than 6.)\nWhile children do appear to be more affected by the flu than by COVID-19, we struggled to find stats that match Forest\u2019s quote.\nWhat experts said\nWe asked experts: Is there a consensus in the medical community that children are \"17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus?\"\n\"I\u2019m not familiar with such a statistic,\" said Bill Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\nNeither is Alan Schroeder, critical care physician at Stanford Children\u2019s Health. Schroeder said he hesitates to put a number on the likelihood of children suffering from the flu more than COVID-19.\n\"The notion that kids aren\u2019t getting really sick is by and large true. But the disparities between influenza and COVID-19 have narrowed considerably,\" he said.\nSchroeder noted that, generally speaking, between 100 and 200 children die each year from the flu in the U.S. (And those deaths occurred at times when the nation isn\u2019t limiting travel or practicing social distancing.)\nMeanwhile, with the novel coronavirus in the U.S. for less than a year, the number of pediatric deaths is still rising.\nAs of Sept. 10, the CDC estimated that 62 children, from infants up to age 14, have died from COVID-19. In the CDC\u2019s 15-24 age bracket, coronavirus has killed another 315 people. Researchers think school cancellations this spring prevented up to even more deaths.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that COVID-19 had killed 90 people under age 20 by mid August.\n\"They\u2019re really oversimplifying the issues at hand,\" Schroeder said of Forest\u2019s quote. In the context of school reopenings, Schroeder said there\u2019s a lot more to consider \u2014 children who have underlying conditions, child-to-adult transmissions \u2014 than a healthy child\u2019s likelihood of dying when compared with the flu.\n\"And for that reason I don\u2019t find it to be a useful comparison,\" he said.","cleaned_claim":"All evidence points to the fact that our kids are 17 times more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than they are from the coronavirus.","ambiguity_score":0.0515506193,"paraphrases":[["The data suggests that children are much more likely to experience negative consequences from the seasonal flu than from the coronavirus.",0.0150673557],["All evidence points to the fact that our kids are more likely to have ill effects from the seasonal flu than from the coronavirus.",0.0087156836],["The data suggests that children are far more likely to experience negative consequences from the flu than from the coronavirus.",0.0165201016],["All evidence indicates that our children are 17 times more likely to experience negative effects from the seasonal flu than from the coronavirus.",0.0515506193],["All evidence suggests that our children are much more likely to experience negative health effects from the seasonal flu than from the coronavirus.",0.0203879401]]}

We rate this Pants on Fire.","full_article":"The mid-pandemic election in Wisconsin yielded no shortage of bizarre storylines.\nBut a noteworthy one emerged late in the day when President Donald Trump tried to put himself at the center of a debate over whether the election should have even been held as scheduled.\nThe April 7, 2020, contest featured a Democratic presidential primary and a Wisconsin Supreme Court race between conservative-backed Daniel Kelly and liberal-backed Jill Karofsky, as well as numerous local elections.\nAt his daily briefing that day, Trump connected his endorsement of Kelly to Gov. Tony Evers\u2019 last-minute attempt to change the election. The implication was Democrats thought they\u2019d have a better chance of boosting Karofsky by extending the election period.\nHere\u2019s an excerpt of Trump\u2019s extended discussion on the topic:\n\"(Wisconsin Democrats) didn't want to move the election. As soon as I endorsed him, the Wisconsin Democrats say, \u2018Oh, let's move the election to two months later, three.\u2019 They didn't mind having the election until I endorsed him, which is very interesting.\"\nSo Trump is saying his endorsement caused Evers to try moving the election back two months.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at that timeline.\nThe (crazy) background\nIn case you lost track of the election back-and-forth, the basics are these:\nEvers had said for weeks he didn\u2019t have the authority to move the election on his own. Then on Friday \u2014 four days before the election \u2014 he called on the Republican Legislature to switch to an all-mail election that would allow votes to come in through May 19, 2020. He also ordered a special session of the Legislature for the following day to take up the matter.\nThe state Assembly and Senate both gaveled out of that session in seconds, without taking action.\nThen, 18 hours before polls opened, Evers issued an order to delay the election to June 9, 2020. Republicans appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, where the conservative majority overturned Evers\u2019 order, clearing the way to hold the election.\nTrump\u2019s endorsement\nTrump is claiming his endorsement of Kelly was a pivotal moment in this back-and-forth.\nTrump sent a tweet at 12:12 p.m. April 3, 2020, saying Kelly has his \"complete endorsement.\" Evers\u2019 call for a mail-in election was released about an hour later.\nBut that\u2019s a coincidence. Here\u2019s why Trump is wrong.\nEvers\u2019 call at that point was not to move the election by two months, but to switch the format to mail-in only and extend the deadline to May. The attempt to move the in-person election to June didn\u2019t come until several days later.\nAnd the Evers\u2019 administration had been moving toward that mail-in announcement well before Trump\u2019s tweet, including calls to Republican leaders, said Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff.\nBut there\u2019s a much more glaring oversight from Trump.\nHe had already endorsed Kelly several months earlier.\nAt a rally in Milwaukee on Jan. 14, 2020, Trump urged his supporters to \"go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law.\"\nAt that time, of course, coronavirus was barely a blip on the national radar. And it was the pandemic that fueled the back-and-forth over Wisconsin\u2019s election, not a repeat of a prior endorsement.\nIn a statement later on Election Day, Evers said Trump was not a factor in his decision-making.\n\"I don\u2019t pay any attention to who the president endorses,\" the governor said. \"Frankly, my focus right now is on keeping the people of this state safe, and that\u2019s why I issued an executive order to extend Wisconsin\u2019s election date and make sure everyone could vote safely from home.\"","cleaned_claim":"As soon as I endorsed Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly, the Wisconsin Democrats said, let\u2019s move the election to two months later.","ambiguity_score":0.0148652913,"paraphrases":[["The Wisconsin Democrats said they wanted to move the election to two months later as soon as I endorsed Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly.",0.0112781059],["After I endorsed Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly, the Wisconsin Democrats said they wanted to move the election to two months later.",0.0148652913],["The Wisconsin Democrats said that they wanted to move the election to two months later as soon as I endorsed Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly.",0.0117987618]]}

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\nThe number of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico has swelled in recent months. But the border is not open for anyone to cross, immigration experts said, despite Pirro\u2019s claim, which suggested that there is no legitimate enforcement at the border.\n\"That claim is patently absurd,\" said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago. \"The border has never been \u2018open to anyone from anywhere in the world who now wishes to enter our country.\u2019\"\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that most migrants they encounter arriving at the southern border are still being immediately expelled under a section of federal law former President Donald Trump invoked in March 2020 to curb the spread of COVID-19. In February, about 72% of the encounters CBP recorded at the border resulted in such expulsions.\n\"The border is not open, and the vast majority of people are being returned under Title 42,\" CBP said in a statement, referencing the name of that section of law. The Department of Homeland Security said Pirro\u2019s claim was false.\n\"There are few exceptions to this closure,\" including unaccompanied minors, added Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. \"Jeanine Pirro\u2019s claim that the border is open to anyone is absurd and reckless.\"\nAsked for evidence, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to Pirro\u2019s own comments March 22 on the program \"The Five,\" when she said she had spoken to sheriffs from locations near the border. \"I\u2019m telling you for a fact, the border is open,\" Pirro said. \"I stood there with a sheriff who showed me where they stopped the wall.\"\nPirro did not provide evidence for her original claim on that show either. She instead argued that due to Biden, \"there is no border, there is no wall.\" However, Biden\u2019s move to stop construction of Trump\u2019s border wall did not include dismantling what was already built.\nThe border is not open to anyone from anywhere\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle is seen next to migrants after they were detained and taken into custody, Sunday, March 21, 2021, in Abram-Perezville, Texas. (AP\/Cortez)\nThe Biden administration is expelling most families and single adults encountered at the border using the same public health rule that Trump invoked during the pandemic, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a March 16 statement.\nRoughly 90% of single adult encounters that the Border Patrol recorded between ports of entry resulted in such expulsions, for example, according to CBP data.\nHowever, the administration is not expelling unaccompanied children, who were previously being expelled under the Trump administration until a federal judge halted the practice in November. An appeals court in January said that the government could resume the practice, but the Biden administration has not. Their arrivals have contributed to the current influx at the border. Unaccompanied minors are allowed to request asylum under U.S. law, Barbato noted.\nIn cases where Mexico cannot receive migrant families sent immediately back from the U.S., border officials are sending those families into immigration proceedings, putting a strain on some regions of the U.S., Mayorkas said in his March 16 statement.\nBut Mayorkas has repeatedly said \u2014 including during a March 17 congressional hearing  and a March 21 interview with ABC News \u2014 that the border is not open.\nBefore the pandemic, many migrants who arrived without a visa were swiftly deported in what are known as expedited removal proceedings, Hallett said. Only those who credibly claimed fear of persecution were cleared to stay in the U.S. while they pursued their asylum claims.\n\"Now, even fewer people are being allowed to enter the U.S. because Border Patrol is using a CDC regulation to expel almost everyone, even people who claim fear,\" Hallett said of the use of the public health-related authority. \"Pirro\u2019s statement has no basis in fact.\"\nThe Biden administration has started gradually letting in asylum seekers who were waiting out their cases from Mexico under Trump\u2019s Remain in Mexico program, but the Border Patrol has continued apprehending some migrants caught trying to enter the U.S. unlawfully between ports of entry. CBP recorded 26,791 apprehensions in February.\nMigrants apprehended at the border are screened for health and security issues, PolitiFact has reported. Mayorkas told Congress March 17 that known and suspected terrorists, for example, are denied entry based on intelligence and vetting procedures.\n\"Individuals who pose a public safety threat will not remain in the United States,\" he added.\nThere were also 1,537 cases in February in which migrants sought to enter the U.S. through legal ports of entry but were deemed inadmissible, according to CBP data.\nThere are many reasons why people seeking legal entry may be declared inadmissible, Hallett said. They could, for example, have criminal histories or suspected ties to terrorism, certain infectious diseases, or a previous deportation on record.\n\"These grounds of inadmissibility were in effect before the pandemic,\" Hallet said. \"Now, it is even more difficult to gain admission to the U.S. because of the public health-related restrictions.

I believe it\u2019s higher than \u2014 give me a place that you think is pretty bad,\" Trump said Aug. 1.\nTrump listened to the crowd. Then he said, \"The guy says \u2018Afghanistan.\u2019 I believe it\u2019s higher than Afghanistan.\"\nThe line got a reaction from the crowd, and in a most literal sense, Trump has a point. But experts who study crime say comparing a city to a country is a misleading political talking point.\nJust the numbers\nBaltimore, a city of just over 600,000, saw 309 homicides last year. That translates to a rate of more than 51 homicides for 100,000 residents.\nThat puts Baltimore\u2019s homicide rate higher than El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), Guatemala (22) and Afghanistan (7), based on the most recent available annual data. (The data isn\u2019t perfect, as we\u2019ll note later.)\nNote: The United Nations said deaths from armed conflict are typically excluded from data on intentional killings, but also notes there are \"challenges of determining the nature of conflict versus non-conflict deaths in Afghanistan.\"\nA flawed approach\nSo that\u2019s the approach Trump took to make his claim. But it\u2019s a flawed one, experts told us. To better understand, consider the difference in crime rates of urban and rural areas.\nTypically, cities experience more crime, including homicides, than rural areas.\nBased on population density, the city of Baltimore is considered an urban area. By contrast, the Northern Triangle countries, as well as Afghanistan, are a mix of both urban and rural.\nFor that reason, measuring Baltimore\u2019s homicide rate against those of entire countries is foolhardy.\n\"Baltimore is 100% urban, but a substantial percent of each nation's population live in rural areas,\" said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. \"It is a comparison between apples and oranges.\"\nThe State Department, as part of its annual survey of crime and safety abroad, took note of the urban-rural crime gap in El Salvador. Last year, five municipalities that account for only 22% of El Salvador\u2019s population saw 40% of the country\u2019s homicides, according to the State Department\u2019s Overseas Security Advisory Council.\nA fairer measure would be to compare the homicide rates of Baltimore with a place like San Salvador, El Salvador\u2019s capital and its most populous city. According to a ranking of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities by the Mexican nongovernmental group Citizens' Council for Public Security, in 2017 San Salvador\u2019s homicide rate was 59 per 100,000 residents \u2014 higher than Baltimore\u2019s 2018 homicide rate.\nPhilip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University, noted that rates fluctuate depending on a number of factors, and rates in Central America can be especially volatile.\nThe homicide rate in El Salvador in 2015 was 103 \u2014 more than double its 2018 number. Cook added that some Central American data also tend to undercount the true number of homicides, another complicating factor when comparing it to an American city.\n\"Given the likelihood of a substantial undercount,\" Cook said, \"I would not bet the ranch that El Salvador was safer than Baltimore in 2018.\"\nAnother way to look at homicide rates would be to compare Maryland, which includes Baltimore, to the countries Trump mentioned. In that case, however, the comparison falls apart.\nMaryland (with a population a little over 6 million) had a homicide rate of 9 per 100,000 people, compared to El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), Guatemala (22) and Afghanistan (7).","cleaned_claim":"The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala. ...\u00a0 I believe it\u2019s higher than Afghanistan.","ambiguity_score":0.6592895985,"paraphrases":[["The homicide rate in Baltimore is significantly higher than in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

We rate it Half True.","full_article":"With Ben Carson officially in the ring of Republican presidential contenders, Democratic social media activists are using his famous scraps-to-scalpel narrative against him.\nCarson, 63, was raised in a single-parent, impoverished household in Detroit and went on to become a Yale University-educated neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Carson, in 1987, was the first doctor to separate twins conjoined at the head.\nThe Facebook group Occupy Democrats accuses Carson of wanting to take away some of the very same government benefits that helped support Carson\u2019s family.\nThe Facebook meme\u00a0shared May 4, 2015, says, \"Tea party icon Dr. Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 \"\n\"But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college.\n\"Hypocrisy, much?\"\nA reader asked us to look into Carson\u2019s biography and see if the facts align with the meme\u2019s claims.\nThe meme is rather thinly sourced to a blogpost that links back to another post that links to another post (as memes do).\nSo we\u2019ll deal with the claims line by line.\n\u2018Grew up in public schools\u2019\nThis checks out.\nRaised by a single mother with a third-grade education, Carson grew up very poor and attended public schools in Detroit, including Higgins Elementary School, Wilson Junior High School, Hunter Junior High School and Southwestern High School, where he graduated third in his class.\nIn his 1990 autobiography Gifted Hands, Carson describes how he briefly attended fourth grade at a small private church school when his mother, Sonya, moved him and his older brother, Curtis, to live with relatives in Boston after the Carsons\u2019 father moved out. His mother thought the boys would get a better education there than at the public schools. She was wrong.\n\"Though Curtis and I both made good grades, the work was not as demanding as it could have been, and when we transferred back to the Detroit public school system I had quite a shock,\" Carson wrote.\n\u2018Got public housing\u2019\nThe details here are a little thin.\nWhen Carson\u2019s mother divorced his father, she received their \"modest house\" in the settlement. Carson described it as the size of most modern garages, less than 1,000 square feet. But as the family\u2019s financial situation deteriorated, they were forced to \"move into the Boston tenements\" with his aunt and uncle.\nIt seems likely from his words that the tenements were for very poor families likely receiving government assistance, perhaps even for the homes. Carson describes \"armies of roaches,\" \"hordes of rats\" and omnipresent \"winos and drunks.\"\nWhen Sonya Carson saved enough to move back to Detroit, the family moved into a multifamily dwelling in Detroit in an \"upper lower-class neighborhood,\" he wrote. Carson doesn\u2019t outright describe the houses as Section 8 or federally funded projects. Other examinations of his life have, such as a Success.com article that described this second Detroit home as in \"Detroit\u2019s downtown housing projects\" and \"the ghetto.\"\nEventually his mother saved enough to return to the Carsons\u2019 original home in a better neighborhood.\nGot \u2018food stamps\u2019\nThis claim checks out.\nIn his autobiography, Carson recounted the humiliation he felt using food stamps from his mom to pay for bread and milk. He would hide from classmates in the grocery store until it was safe to check out unnoticed.\nAs hard as his mother worked in various domestic jobs, it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the family completely off of public assistance, he wrote.\n\"By the time I went into ninth grade, Mother had made such strides that she received nothing except food stamps,\" he wrote. \"She couldn't have provided for us and kept up the house without that subsidy.\"\n\u2018Got free glasses from a government program\u2019\nThis, too, is correct.\nAn eye exam in the fifth grade proved life-changing for Carson. In the fourth chapter of Gifted Hands, he says it wasn\u2019t until he failed to read letters on a chart on the wall that he realized his eyesight had deteriorated over time, contributing in part to his struggles at school.\n\"The school provided glasses for me, free,\" he wrote.\nCarson counts his glasses as a significant reason for his improvement in school because he could finally see the chalkboard.\n\u2018Was helped by affirmative action\u2019\nThis claim is unproven.\nCarson wanted to go out of state for college, even though the University of Michigan in his home state \"actively recruited black students\" and was willing to waive application fees for low-income students, he wrote. He narrowed his sights on either Harvard or Yale, and decided to go with Yale after an impressive win against Harvard on College Bowl on TV.\nHe started classes at\u00a0Yale in 1969 and received a 90 percent scholarship, he wrote.\nWere affirmative action policies to thank for his admission?\nCarson\u2019s resume was impressive \u2014 he was third in his class, advanced so high within ROTC that he was offered a scholarship to West Point, and had high test scores.\nStill, Carson says he knew his minority background was valuable, saying \"most of the top colleges were scrambling to enroll Blacks.\"\n\"The school reps flocked around me because of my high academic achievements, and because I had done exceptionally well on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), ranking somewhere in the low ninetieth percentile--again, unheard of from a student in the inner city of Detroit,\" he wrote.\nAfter graduating from Yale with a degree in psychology, Carson was accepted into the University of Michigan Medical School, which he chose because it was in his home state, meaning lower tuition, and it was highly rated.\nIn 1976, he applied for his residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, which he said took only two interns a year. The school chose Carson, who said he made an impression on his interviewer by sharing a love for classical music.\n\"Years later Dr. Udvarhelyi told me that he had made a strong case for my being accepted to Dr. Long, the chairman,\" he wrote. \" \u2018Ben,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018I was impressed with your grades, your honors and recommendations, and the splendid way you handled yourself in the interview.\u2019 \"\nCarson remained convinced that their exchange over a classical music concert gave him an edge. He did not, however, mention his race.\n\u2018Got Pell grants for college\u2019\nThis claim, too, is unproven and in many ways the weakest claim tracing Carson\u2019s life story.\nCarson definitely received financial assistance to pay for college, but he does not offer details about the grants, at least not in Gifted Hands or to reporters in the last two decades. He also worked during the summers to help pay for other costs during school.\nThe only mention of \"Ben Carson\" and \"Pell Grants\" in a LexisNexis search is in the context of his criticism of Obama\u2019s proposal to offer free community college.\n\"First of all, it is only free if no one has to pay for it. It is not free if we rob Peter to pay Paul,\" Carson wrote in a February column. \"Secondly, Pell grants already exist to pay for community college expenses for needy students. For those who are not needy, there is an old-fashioned remedy that is very effective called work. In fact work might even be beneficial for those who are needy. It certainly provided some very valuable experiences for me.\"\nThe article the meme holds up as support for its claims references a since-deleted post from a Facebook user who said Carson \"benefited from affirmative action to enter college; used federal loans and Pell grants in undergrad school; benefited from affirmative action to enter medical school,\" and \"med school paid for with grant from USPHS.\"\nWe contacted the author about where he got this information via Facebook. We\u2019ll update the story if anything becomes of it.\nComparing Carson\u2019s life story and his political platform\nThe meme, of course, is trying to accomplish more than just recounting Carson\u2019s biography. It\u2019s also suggesting Carson would end many of the programs he benefited from growing up.\nThat is the most difficult allegation to prove of all.\nCarson directly addressed this criticism May 4, 2015, the day he announced his run for president.\n\"Many people are critical of me because they say, \u2018Carson wants to get rid of all the safety nets and welfare programs even though he must have benefited from them,\u2019 \" he said, according to a Politico account. \"This is a blatant lie. I have no desire to get rid of safety nets for people who need them. I have a strong desire to get rid of programs that create dependency in able-bodied people.\"\nThis is similar to his response to a question about how he would get his message to minority voters at February\u2019s 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\"I\u2019m not interested in getting rid of the safety net,\" he said. \"I\u2019m interested in getting rid of dependency, and I want us to find a way to allow people to excel in our society, and as more and more people hear that message, they will recognize who is truly on their side and who is trying to keep them suppressed and cultivate their votes.\"\nCarson\u2019s campaign website does not mention specific reforms to the safety net, but his rhetoric indicates he indeed wants to eliminate government dependency. What\u2019s not clear is if that would involve axing the same programs that helped his family get by decades ago.\nFor the record, we could not locate the exact quote referenced in the meme \"Eliminate dependency on government,\" though that language wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Carson.\nCarson spokeswoman Deana Bass said Carson\u2019s \"family did receive benefits briefly when he was growing up in Detroit,\" but didn\u2019t answer our specific questions about whether he used Pell grants or grew up in public housing.","cleaned_claim":"Ben Carson is running for president to \u2018eliminate dependency on government.\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t mention that he grew up in public schools, got public housing and food stamps, got free glasses from a government program, was helped by Affirmative Action, and got Pell Grants for college.","ambiguity_score":0.3458158076,"paraphrases":[["Ben Carson is running for president with the goal of reducing dependence on government assistance.

Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (with others on the way) were able to develop as quickly as they did due to a breakthrough vaccine mechanism, billions in federal funding and an array of bureaucratic fast-tracking that allowed faster production, simultaneous trials and timely approvals.\nThose vaccines were together tested on more than 100,000 people. And with millions of people now safely and effectively vaccinated, we see that safety claims made based on the trials were indeed valid. Which makes Edming\u2019s claim ridiculous.\nWe rate Edming\u2019s claim Pants on Fire.","full_article":"State Rep. James Edming doesn\u2019t trust the COVID-19 vaccine.\nHe even told a Wisconsin Assembly committee, \"we should eliminate\" it.\nExplaining his objection, the 75-year-old Republican from Glen Flora, in rural northern Wisconsin, has repeatedly cited a personal anecdote, most recently in a March 23, 2021, floor session of the Wisconsin state Assembly.\nAs lawmakers debated several bills that would prohibit mandatory vaccinations, Edming told of a friend whose wife died of cancer.\n\"His wife was 70 years old, and 71 years ago, there was a vaccination that they gave women so they wouldn\u2019t have a miscarriage, and his mother-in-law took that vaccination,\" Edming said. \"His mother-in-law died at age 70. His wife died at age 70, and their daughter is sterile.\n\"That\u2019s what the research has been able to follow up on in 70 years, and you think I\u2019m going to take something because some scientist says that it\u2019s good for me. And looking at and listening to what my friend has to say, there\u2019s got to be a little more research before I take something. There may be a vaccination that\u2019s for this, but you can\u2019t tell me they can solve this in eight to 10 months. Or a year. It takes more time than that. There hasn\u2019t even been any animal research on this.\"\nEdming covers a lot of territory here. A few quick notes before we go deeper.\nHis anecdote references a treatment that has indeed proven to have tragic, long-term consequences. But it wasn\u2019t a vaccine, and it was developed in very different circumstances more than 80 years ago. More on this later.\n\n\nEdming is flat wrong about animal research. All three vaccines in use now in the U.S. were tested on animals in addition to the expansive human trials.\nBut we\u2019ll focus mostly on the timing-based claim. Is it really not realistic to develop a safe vaccine in less than a year?\nHow the COVID-19 vaccines were developed\nThe most obvious rebuttal to Edming\u2019s claim is that millions of Americans have been safely vaccinated.\nThe CDC requires all deaths following vaccinations to be reported, which sparks a review of the death certificate, autopsy and other documents to check for a connection. Through March 22, 2,216 deaths were reported among 126 million vaccine doses administered so far in the U.S. But that doesn\u2019t mean those are tied to the vaccine. In a sample so large, there will be people who die of other causes and, according to the CDC, those documents \"revealed no evidence that vaccinations contributed to patient deaths.\"\nMeanwhile, some people have reported side effects, including two to five per million who experience anaphylaxis \u2014 a severe allergic reaction.\nBut Edming\u2019s criticism focused on the speed of the process, so let\u2019s dig in to how the vaccines got to this point so quickly.\nDefending Edming\u2019s claim, his staff pointed to a vaccine history website from the College of Physicians of Philadelphia that says, \"Vaccine development is a long, complex process, often lasting 10-15 years.\"\nHowever, the same website details CDC guidance on the COVID-19 vaccines, including this: \"Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines, and these vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.\"\nThat gets to the heart of where Edming goes wrong.\nThe process that led to today\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines is unlike anything that came before it. The unprecedented global consequences of the coronavirus pandemic spawned an equally unprecedented global cooperation in pursuit of a vaccine.\nThis was made possible by a new method of developing vaccines, mass numbers of infections that accelerated clinical trials and governments willing to eliminate bureaucratic and financial roadblocks, the New York Times reported. While the vaccine process involved breakthroughs, they were built on research that goes back decades.\n\"These vaccines were fast-tracked, but the parts that were fast-tracked were the paperwork; so the administrative approvals, the time to get the funding,\" Dr. Andrew Badley, COVID-19 Research Task Force Chair at the Mayo Clinic, said in a video produced by the hospital system. \"Because these vaccines have such great interest, the time it took to enroll patients was very, very fast. The follow-up was as thorough as it is for any vaccine.\"\nEach of the three vaccines now in use in the U.S. went through the standard three phases of human testing. Stage 3 testing conducted prior to receiving emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration involved 43,448 people for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, 30,420 people for Moderna and 43,783 people for Johnson & Johnson.\nThe FDA describes the process this way on its website:\n\"In public health emergencies, such as a pandemic, the development process may be atypical. For example, as demonstrated by the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has coalesced government agencies, international counterparts, academia, nonprofit organizations and pharmaceutical companies to develop a coordinated strategy for prioritizing and speeding development of the most promising vaccines. In addition, the federal government has made investments in the necessary manufacturing capacity at its own risk, giving companies confidence that they can invest aggressively in development and allowing faster distribution of an eventual vaccine. However, efforts to speed vaccine development to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have not sacrificed scientific standards, integrity of the vaccine review process, or safety.\"\nIn the U.S., that government funding came from Operation Warp Speed, an initiative launched under the Trump Administration that laid out $18 billion to accelerate vaccine development and manufacturing.\nSteps to speed the process included beginning large-scale manufacturing during clinical trials, running some phases of clinical trials at the same time and investing in multiple types of vaccines to increase the chances of success, according to a February 2021 report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. Among the six potential vaccines Operation Warp Speed invested in, two used messenger RNA, two used viral vector technology that deploys an altered cold virus and two focused on the virus\u2019s spike protein.\nThe first two vaccines approved here \u2014 Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna \u2014 are particularly noteworthy in their use of messenger RNA, a new approach to vaccine creation. Vaccines built on mRNA have a general structure into which the genetic code needed to address a virus can be quickly loaded, rather than developing an entire vaccine from scratch. Moderna likens the process to loading a program or app into a computer\u2019s operating system.\nDrs. Sabrina Murphy and Maggie Nolan\u00a0of the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health reviewed research on the matter at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n\"There have been over three decades of mRNA vaccine research and development on vaccines for other disease such as influenza, Zika virus, and rabies virus. Additionally, mRNA-based cancer vaccines have been used in numerous cancer clinical trials with promising results,\" the doctors said in a joint statement. \"The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine development was actually preceded by decades of research into understanding the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines and has made the COVID-19 vaccine a miracle of circumstances. It has allowed for a COVID-19 vaccine to be developed and tested much more rapidly.\"\nThe anecdote\nBefore we wrap up, let\u2019s circle back to the anecdote Edming cited. It\u2019s the same story he shared in a March 3 hearing before the Committee on Constitution and Ethics, where he recalled the friend\u2019s deceased wife as an \"awesome, awesome lady.\"\nTyler Longsine, a research assistant for Edming, said they didn\u2019t know the nature of the drug involved \u2014 despite Edming\u2019s repeated use of the story.\nBut experts consulted by PolitiFact Wisconsin say his description lines up with the history of a drug called Diethylstilbestrol, or DES. It\u2019s a hormone supplement that was given to between 5 and 10 million women as a pill, injection, cream or suppository from the 1940s to the 1970s, the CDC reported. Doctors believed it would prevent miscarriages.\nThe National Institutes of Health said few studies were done on the drug before it was produced, however, causing it to be given to women worldwide in inconsistent doses. DES was in use long before a sweeping 1962 bill overhauled FDA drug approval requirements, making manufacturers prove the effectiveness of drugs before marketing them.\nBy 1953, research had shown DES did not prevent miscarriages or premature birth. But many doctors continued using it until research in early 1970s revealed children exposed to DES in utero were more likely to suffer from infertility and cancer of reproductive tissues \u2014 in line with Edming\u2019s story.\nAs tragic as this outcome was for Edming\u2019s friend and countless other families, their situation is not comparable to the COVID-19 vaccine. DES was a medication, not a vaccine. And it was developed 82 years ago under looser standards that led it to be administered erratically.\n\"The only similarity between DES and vaccines is that both may be given through injection,\" Murphy and Nolan\u00a0said in their statement. \"We give many medications by injection \u2014 think of insulin, for example \u2014 and they have nothing to do with vaccines.\"","cleaned_claim":"You can\u2019t tell me they can develop a safe vaccine in eight to 10 months.

But polls indicate that the public shows a bit less conviction when asked whether government should address the issue, though much seems to depend on how the questions are asked.\nLet\u2019s take a look.\nPublic views on climate change\nBennet\u2019s climate change plan, which was released in May, includes a goal for the United States to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Bennet based his claim on a politics and global warming report published in April by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication.\nThe Yale and GMU programs use social science to help communicate climate change to the public.\nThe report states that 70% of U.S. registered voters said global warming is happening. A majority \"strongly\" or \"somewhat\" support investments in renewable energy research and infrastructure (87%), regulating pollution (82%) and\/or taxing pollution (72%). Also, nearly four in ten voters said a candidate\u2019s position on global warming will be very important when they decide who they vote for in the 2020 presidential election.\nWe looked at other polls about climate change and found that responses vary on whether or not Americans believe climate change is real.\nOne way to analyze the first part of Bennet\u2019s statement is to examine Americans\u2019 views on the timeline of the effects of global warming.\nA Gallup poll conducted in March found that 59% of Americans said that the effects of global warming have already begun and 66% believe it\u2019s mostly due to pollution from human activities. The percentage of people polled who believe the effects of global warming are already underway has fluctuated over the years, but it\u2019s steadily climbed from 49% in 2011 to 52% in 2012 to where we are today.\nGallup does note differences in how Americans view the issue based on their political leanings. Among those who describe themselves as conservative, only 25% were classified as concerned believers, compared to 81% of liberals and 56% of moderates.\nPublic views on climate change policies\nSo, is Bennet also on point when he says that most Americans support doing something about climate change? The results are mixed.\nA Quinnipiac University poll released in 2018 found that the majority of American voters, 69%, are \"somewhat\" or \"very\" concerned about climate change.\nBut a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January found that only 44% of Americans said global climate change should be a top priority for President Donald Trump and Congress. It was low on a list of 18 issues prioritized by the adults surveyed. However, the environment, categorized as a separate issue, was at No. 8, behind the economy, health care, education, terrorism, Social Security, Medicare and the poor and needy.\nA Gallup poll conducted last year found that 62% of Americans think the U.S. government is doing too little to protect the environment. The majority of Americans support governmental policies aimed at mitigating climate change such as spending more on solar and wind power (76%), setting higher emissions and pollution standards for businesses and industry (74%) and imposing mandatory controls on greenhouse gas emissions (67%).\nJohn Kotcher, a research assistant professor at GMU\u2019s Center for Climate Change Communication, told PolitiFact that views on climate change among scientists and the general public vary in part because people have not always seen the issue as one that directly affects them.\n\"Historically, climate change has been framed as an environmental issue that\u2019s distant in time and space \u2014 that it\u2019s a problem for plants, penguins and polar bears,\" he said.\nKotcher helped conduct the survey Bennet\u2019s campaign referenced.","cleaned_claim":"The vast majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and we need to do something about it.","ambiguity_score":0.0112989079,"paraphrases":[["The majority of Americans believe that climate change is real and that something needs to be done about it.",0.0076039149],["The majority of Americans believe in climate change and feel that something needs to be done about it.",0.0112989079],["Most Americans believe that climate change is real and that something needs to be done about it.",0.0076101427],["A large majority of Americans believe climate change is real and that action needs to be taken.",0.0076866066],["Most Americans believe that climate change is a reality and that something needs to be done about it.",0.0073266439]]}

Their hotel stays are part of public health measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19.\nIngraham\u2019s claim contains an element of truth but gives a misleading impression by omitting important context about the circumstances of their hotel stays.\nWe rate this claim Mostly False.","full_article":"As former President Donald Trump was tried in the Senate for inciting an insurrection, Fox News host Laura Ingraham accused Democrats of plotting their own insurrection by \"enticing illegals to bust through our borders, exploit our resources and commit crimes.\"\nIngraham said immigrants were exploiting American hospitality. \"You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden\u2019s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge,\" Ingraham said Feb. 8, citing a report in the New York Times.\n\"It sounds so pleasant. Can you believe that? At a time when our own people are suffering,\" Ingraham said, after reading a snippet from the report.\nAs part of a story about an influx of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, the New York Times reported that some migrants arriving in San Diego were quarantining in a hotel in order to comply with California\u2019s 10-day quarantine requirement for out-of-state travelers.\n\"To guard against the coronavirus, health authorities in San Diego have arranged housing for hundreds of arriving migrants in a downtown high-rise hotel, where they are being quarantined before being allowed to join family or friends in the interior of the United States,\" the newspaper found.\nA clip from Ingraham\u2019s monologue was flagged as part of Facebook\u2019s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So PolitiFact decided to put her claim about \"illegals\" at hotels to the Truth-O-Meter.\nWe spoke with immigration experts and Jewish Family Service of San Diego, the nonprofit social-services agency that\u2019s helping families through their hotel quarantines in San Diego.\nIt\u2019s true that arriving migrants are quarantining in a hotel in at least that one location, they said.\nBut they said Ingraham was wrong to characterize the public health measure as an amenity for \"illegals.\" It involves migrants who were let into the U.S. to seek asylum.\n\"The hotel stay is not a vacation,\" said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago. \"It is designed as a public health measure to protect the entire community.\"\nEitan Peled, a border services advocate with Jewish Family Service, said the migrants quarantining at the hotel include some who came through ports of entry and some who were apprehended after entering the country unlawfully.\n\"Every one of these migrants is asserting their legal right to seek international protection in the United States,\" Peled said.\nWhat\u2019s happening in San Diego\nThe hotel-quarantine setup in San Diego was covered in the New York Times\u2019 report, and also by KSWB-TV, a Fox affiliate in San Diego, and the San Diego Union-Tribune.\nKSWB-TV reported Feb. 9 that the migrants in question \"have been allowed to remain in the U.S. after asking for asylum\" and were turned over to Jewish Family Service.\nImmigrants who are physically present in the U.S. can seek asylum regardless of whether they are in the country legally or illegally, as PolitiFact has reported. They generally have to apply for asylum within one year of arriving in the U.S. For that reason, immigration experts took issue with Ingraham\u2019s characterization of the migrants in San Diego\u2019s hotel as \"illegals.\"\n\"A person can seek asylum at a port of entry to the United States or within the interior of the United States,\" said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. \"If a person crossed the border without inspection, that person was not \u2018admitted\u2019 into the United States, but that does not make the person \u2018illegal.\u2019\"\nIn San Diego, the immigrants quarantining in a hotel are those who have been released by immigration officials while they wait to present their case in an immigration court, Peled said.\nThey have \"passed a credible fear interview conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, and are now awaiting their asylum cases in the U.S.,\" he said.\nWhen immigrants claim asylum, they are processed and either detained or released to friends or family who promise that they will appear at future court hearings, Hallett said. But getting people to their sponsors can be tricky in a pandemic, when travel is restricted.\n\"Thus, the government releases people to a local nonprofit that assists with the quarantine and then ensures that they arrive at their final destination,\" Hallett said. \"It appears that Jewish Family Service is playing this role in San Diego.\"\nPeled said JFS is helping families through their quarantines by providing case management as well as financial and travel assistance. He said the effort is part of San Diego County\u2019s ability to access federal funding for reimbursement of \"non-congregate sheltering\" \u2014 that is, temporary living arrangements that avoid crowding to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.\nA spokesperson for the Border Patrol in the San Diego sector told the San Diego Union-Tribune that COVID-19 restrictions have caused some facilities to reach \"maximum safe holding capacity,\" prompting the release of some migrants before their court hearings.\nThe practice of releasing immigrants until they appear before a judge was less common under Trump, Barbato said. The Trump administration starting in 2019 forced migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases moved through the immigration system.\nIt isn\u2019t clear how many places are using hotels like San Diego. The Associated Press reported that a Texas charity was testing migrants released by the Border Patrol for COVID-19 and sending those with infections to isolate in a hotel.\nA Fox News spokesperson cited the transcript from Ingraham\u2019s show, where she referred specifically to what was happening in San Diego after first mentioning the hotel quarantines.\nBut Ingraham\u2019s broader claim that \"illegals \u2026 get to stay free of charge\" could have given some viewers the impression that President Joe Biden\u2019s policy was opening up free hotel rooms along the border to immigrants who were in the country unlawfully.\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki said Feb. 10 that the \"vast majority have been turned away.\"","cleaned_claim":"You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden\u2019s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge.","ambiguity_score":0.2355521619,"paraphrases":[["Illegal immigrants who have arrived since Joe Biden's inauguration are being allowed to stay in hotels free of charge.",0.0859105438],["Illegal immigrants who have arrived since Biden's inauguration are staying in hotels for free.",0.2355521619],["Illegal immigrants who have arrived in the United States since Joe Biden's inauguration are being allowed to stay in hotels for free.",0.0642940998],["Illegal immigrants arriving in the US since Biden's inauguration have been given free accommodation in hotels.",0.0427575782],["Illegal immigrants who have arrived in the United States since Joe Biden's inauguration are being given free hotel accommodation.",0.1142557785]]}

Clarke Jr., a Donald Trump supporter and nationally known conservative, has harshly criticized the group.\nYet, we wondered if he has gone as far as the Sheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate draft committee says he has.\nAs reported by the liberal magazine Mother Jones, the committee sent a fundraising email on April 5, 2017 that suggested several reasons why Clarke would make a good senator -- starting with this one:\n\"Milwaukee\u2019s conservative black Sheriff CORRECTLY says \u2018BLACK LIVES MATTER\u2019 is a terrorist movement, a hate group, and calls it \u2018Black LIES Matter.\u2019\"\nThe committee also makes the statement on its website.\nLet\u2019s look at each of the three parts.\nThe committee\nSheriff David Clarke for U.S. Senate is not a committee authorized by Clarke, but is registered with the Federal Election Commission as an official draft campaign.\nIt has attacked first-term U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, for being a lesbian as part of its effort to get Clarke to run against her in 2018. Clarke has not ruled out a run, but hasn\u2019t expressed strong interest, either, while a number of Republicans have.\nFor her part, Baldwin has said Clarke is \"being groomed\" to challenge her, and has raised campaign funds herself off his possible candidacy.\nWhile a favorite of the right, Clarke has drawn criticism for his racial remarks as well as for his performance as sheriff as he increasingly spends time on national television and traveling the country on speaking engagements. He has also said virtually nothing about four inmate deaths in the jail he manages that are under investigation.\nNow to the statement about what Clarke said.\n\u2018Hate group\u2019\nBlack Lives Matter formed after a Florida jury in 2013 found George Zimmerman not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen. Describing its aim as rebuilding \"the black liberation movement,\" the group has participated around the country in demonstrations, including some around Milwaukee, about police killings of black people.\nClarke called Black Lives Matter a \"hate group\" in a July 2016 opinion column he wrote for FoxNews.com and has made any number of similar references such as these:\n\"I wish the Southern Poverty Law Center would add them (Black Lives Matter) to the list of hate groups in America \u2026 this hateful ideology of Black Lives Matter.\" -- Fox News\u2019 \"America\u2019s News HQ,\" July 31, 2016\n\"Black Lives Matter are purveyors of hate.

But it\u2019s a conglomeration of misfits. You have Occupy movement, you have organized labor in on it now, you have criminals, you have black racialists, you have cop haters and anarchists have now formed together this faux movement, if you will.\"\n\u2018Terrorist movement\u2019\nClarke hasn\u2019t used a terrorism reference nearly as often, but he does so twice in his book:\nBlack Lives Matter does not \"care about black lives.

That\u2019s because the media protect and lie about this insidious terror organization.\"\nClarke also predicted on Twitter in 2015 that Black Lives Matter \"will join forces with ISIS to being (sic) down our legal constituted republic.\"\nAnd in a July 2016 column he wrote for The Hill, he said: \"We have several forces internal and external attacking our rule of law: ISIS, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street \u2013 just the most recent iterations of the elements who brand themselves as unique but seek the same revolutionary aim: take down the West \u2026\"","cleaned_claim":"Milwaukee County Sheriff David A.

He said during one debate in 2014 that he would reverse the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade if given the opportunity.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Katko told the Post-Standard newspaper in Syracuse last year he supported funding until a set of videos was released that implied the organization was harvesting fetal tissue for sale. The creator of those videos has since faced charges related to the incident. Katko also went on the radio last September to explain why he changed his position.\n\"It\u2019s never an easy issue, right? Before, when I was running in the campaign, I was absolutely for funding for Planned Parenthood. The law is clear that any federal funds for Planned Parenthood can\u2019t be used for abortions, so that\u2019s not an issue,\" Katko told Grant Reeher on WRVO.

It\u2019s about whether they\u2019re breaking the law or not,\" Katko said.\nThe first and second votes\nThe videos sparked state investigations into Planned Parenthood and a renewed effort to strip the organization of federal funding in Congress. In September 2015, The Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was brought to the House Floor.\nKatko voted twice to advance the legislation. In his first vote, Katko opposed a proposed amendment to reconsider the bill. His vote helped keep the legislation on the House floor. His second vote supported the actual bill, which passed in the House but was not brought to a vote in the Senate.\nThe third vote\nThen during federal budget negotiations last year, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was slipped into a one-house resolution to fund the federal government. It included the same language as the standalone bill. The House, with the help of Katko, passed the resolution. The Senate did not.\nThe fourth vote\nThe fourth vote happened a few weeks later when Republicans in the House tried to defund the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare.\nTucked away in that legislation was language that would have stripped federal funding to any entity that provided abortion services. Katko voted for the legislation. The House passed the measure, but the bill did not become law.","cleaned_claim":"Rep.

About 26 percent of the bills she sponsored had support from a Republican.\nClinton\u2019s claim is partially accurate. We rate her statement Half True.","full_article":"Hillary Clinton insists that her track record as a U.S. senator is proof that she could bring a spirit of bipartisanship to a presidential administration.\nSpeaking from her campaign jet following a rally in Pittsburgh on Oct. 22, Clinton said her prior political experience shows she\u2019s been willing to work with Republicans.\n\"I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every Republican I served with,\" she said. \"I think last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor. You don\u2019t get that done unless you work with folks on the other side.\"\nWe wanted to check whether Clinton sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills, and whether she was as chummy with her Senate rivals as she claimed.\nTallying bills\nClinton won election to the U.S. Senate in 2000 to represent New York and was re-elected in 2006. Her tenure was from January 2001 to January 2009, when she resigned to become secretary of state.\nWe first wanted to know to which 400 bills Clinton was referring. She\u2019s used that figure before, such as the Oct. 9 presidential debate, but we couldn\u2019t find a clear definition of which legislation she meant. We contacted Clinton\u2019s campaign, which sent us a list of 400 measures they said had passed Congress and become law.\nThe list included more than bills, which are written by lawmakers and become laws if they pass Congress and are signed by the president.\nClinton\u2019s list included resolutions, which often are used to express lawmaker opinions or affect congressional workings, and amendments, which are parts of bills added on while legislation is being considered. Clinton\u2019s 400-bill list also includes House versions of her measures (bills, amendments and resolutions) that passed.\nAgain, Clinton said \"bills\" as a senator, not \"House bills,\" not \"amendments,\" and not \"resolutions.\" Those things may eventually have the effect of laws, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are bills that \"have my name on them.\"\nAccording to the official website for federal legislative information, Congress.gov, Clinton introduced 713 pieces of legislation over her two terms. Of that count, 363 were Senate bills, while the rest were amendments or resolutions.\nOf the bills Clinton sponsored, only three actually became law. One established a historic site in New York, one renamed a post office and one named a highway.\nHer Democratic New York counterpart Charles Schumer was the single co-sponsor for all three. (Co-sponsoring is just a way for a lawmaker to show he or she supports a piece of legislation after it has been written.) The laws were uncontroversial and passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and voice vote in the House before being signed by President George W. Bush.\nClinton is listed as a co-sponsor on 74 bills that became law. Of those, 27 bills were sponsored by a Republican.\nWorking with Republicans\nSo Clinton is exaggerating a bit when talking about the number of bills she sponsored or co-sponsored. But what about her claim that she worked in a bipartisan fashion?\nAccording to our count, of the 363 bills she introduced in the Senate, 93 were co-sponsored by Republicans, or about 26 percent. A single Republican co-sponsored 48, while two or more members of the GOP signed onto 45 of the bills.\nWe also checked GovTrack.us for Republican senators who co-sponsored a Clinton bill. Republicans were listed as a co-sponsor 241 times in the 355 bills she sponsored that were referred to a Senate committee. But that could include the same senator listed multiple times in different bills.\nSen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, for instance, co-sponsored six pieces of Clinton legislation. Four of those measures had 10 or more Republican co-sponsors, so there\u2019s plenty of duplication.\nClinton\u2019s campaign noted that almost every Republican senator co-sponsored a Clinton bill at one time or another. They\u00a0provided a list showing that 57 of the 65 GOP senators who served at the same time as Clinton signed onto her bills.\nExperts who study Congress have told us that the number of sponsored or co-sponsored bills signed into law isn\u2019t a thorough measure of effectiveness or productivity for a member of the Senate. Adding amendments, writing language for bills, holding hearings and helping constituents are all good indicators of performance.\n\"By any reasonable standard, including the private comments of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle when she was in the Senate, she was very effective,\" American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein told PolitiFact for an earlier fact-check.","cleaned_claim":"400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor.

The association that determined the total also noted there was no data on whether the crops had really been left to rot in fields. The dollar figure was measured through a survey of farmers\u2019 potential lost revenue.\nAs for the reasons for the shortage, LeftScoop.com drastically oversimplifies the issue in the text by interjecting that Trump\u2019s immigration policies are to blame for a lack of migrant workers. For starters, the data is from 2015, more than a year before Trump became president.\nThis post is partially accurate, but not much more. We rate it Half True.","full_article":"A news story about California farmers losing money because of a labor shortage has drawn attention on Facebook because it lays the blame on President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nA June 28, 2017, post on LeftScoop.com ran under the headline, \"Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants.\" The link has been shared more than 90,000 times in three weeks.\nFacebook users flagged the story as potentially being fabricated, as part of the social media giant\u2019s efforts to combat fake news.\nIn this case, the story isn\u2019t fake.\nBut it\u2019s not accurate, either.\nThe post is largely comprised almost entirely of uncredited passages from two legitimate news sources. It then adds anti-Trump sentiment for effect. We emailed the website that created the post, LeftScoop.com, to ask about the post and why the site did not include its sources but didn\u2019t get a reply. The post was removed shortly after our inquiry.\nUnderstanding the story\nThe LeftScoop.com article starts by using several slightly edited paragraphs from a June 22 story from the Santa Barbara Independent, a weekly alternative newspaper based in Santa Barbara, Calif. \"Labor shortage leaves $13 million in crops to rot in fields,\" the newspaper article\u2019s headline read. The LeftScoop.com post also borrows from a 2017 Mother Jones article.\nThe Independent\u2019s story said that the county\u2019s agricultural industry has suffered labor shortages from 15 to 26 percent annually for five consecutive years. It cited Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties statistics that said $13 million worth of strawberries, broccoli and other produce were plowed under, up from $4.4 million worth five years ago. Other outlets have cited the Independent story when writing about the subject.\nLeftScoop.com\u2019s post implied Trump was largely to blame for the lost crops because he had scared off Mexican migrant workers with his tough policies, causing the labor shortages.\nThat\u2019s wrong.\nClaire Wineman, the Grower-Shipper Association\u2019s president, told us Santa Barbara County has been experiencing the same lack of workers felt by agricultural areas across California and the United States.\nThe dollar figure in the story came from an annual survey the Grower-Shipper Association sent to local farmers, asking them to quantify how much gross revenue they estimated they had lost due to a lack of a sufficient number of field workers. The total from 68 respondents amounted to $13.5 million for the 2015 calendar year.\nTrump took office Jan. 20, 2017.\n\"We absolutely have been experiencing labor shortages over the last few years,\" Wineman said. The Independent\u2019s story, she said, did a fair job of describing the reasons, which go back years before Trump took office.\nOne thing the Independent story (and therefore the LeftScoop.com post) did misrepresent was in the headline, Wineman said. The survey didn\u2019t determine whether the crops went unharvested and rotted in the fields.\n\"We didn\u2019t survey what happened, we only asked how much revenue was not realized because of a lack of workers,\" Wineman said. \"We just don\u2019t know that.\"","cleaned_claim":"Over $13 million worth of crops have ROTTED in California, all because no one is willing to work jobs vacated by migrants.","ambiguity_score":0.6722330451,"paraphrases":[["Over $13 million worth of crops have gone to waste in California because there is a lack of workers to replace those who have migrated elsewhere.",0.0203033723],["Crops worth over $13 million have gone to waste in California because there is a lack of workers to fill the jobs vacated by migrants.",0.0136779454],["Over $13 million worth of crops have gone to waste in California because there is a shortage of workers to harvest them.

Scott Walker.\nBut what about the many parts of his claim?\nIs he right?\nLooking at the claim\nWhen asked to back up Rothschild\u2019s claim, Democracy Campaign researcher Michael Buelow pointed to the spending reports from the NRA\u2019s Political Victory Fund, available on the webpage of the Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information System.\nFor our purposes, we are dividing the claim into four parts:\nThe NRA is one of the biggest lobbyists in Madison\nAccording to a report from the Wisconsin Ethics Commission, titled \"Total Lobbying Expenditures Sorted by Total Dollars,\" the NRA spent $126,987 on lobbying for the period of January 2017 to June 2018 (the most recent data available online).\nThat meant it ranked 109 out of 793 groups. But that is far from \"one of the biggest.\" The top spender on lobbying, for instance, was Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, which spent more than $1 million in that period.\nSo that part of the claim falls short.\nThat the NRA is among the biggest spenders on Wisconsin elections\nRothschild used the phrase \"a ton of money.\" In our minds, that means it is one of the biggest spenders on the election\nAccording to a November 2018 news release by the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign itself, here are the top 10 independent expenditure groups from the fall election:\nAmericans for Prosperity -- $7.4 million\n\n\nRight Direction Wisconsin PAC (RGA Wisconsin) -- $6.5 million\n\n\nACC Wisconsin PAC -- $4.3 million\n\nFeatured Fact-check\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelda Helen Roys\n\n\nstated on May 8, 2022 in TV interview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to U.S. Senate rules, Democrats need \"more than a majority ... to codify Roe vs. Wade.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy D.L.

But its tally is far below the $2.3 million that would put it in the Top 5, or the $7.4 million at the very top.\nSo this part of the claim is off a bit as well.\nMore than $1 million in spending in 2018\nPolitiFact Wisconsin searched the Wisconsin Campaign Finance Information site 2018 entries for \"NRA Political Victory Fund -- Federal PAC\" and found the following:\n-- Spending against Evers: $872,915.46\n-- Spending for Walker: $67,669.09\n-- Spending for Michael Screnock (state Supreme Court candidate): $44,159.98\n-- Spending for Brad Schimel (attorney general): $14,570.81\n-- Spending for Andre Jacque (state Senate): $2,432.85\nThat is more than $1 million on elections in 2018, so that part of the claim hits the target.\nMost of the spending was for Walker or against Evers\nThe final part of the claim also hits the mark -- of the more than $1 million total, $940,584 was either for Walker, or opposing Evers.\nAttempts to obtain comment from an NRA spokeswoman were unsuccessful.","cleaned_claim":"The NRA is one of the biggest lobbyists here in the capital.

Asked what Trump was referring to, the Trump campaign cited a passage in the Times report, which described how Trump got a $72.9 million tax refund due to a change made under President Barack Obama.\nThe change was part of a law enacted during the Great Recession. It allowed net operating losses incurred by businesses in 2008 and 2009 to be deducted from tax liability for the previous five years, rather than the prior limit restricting such \"carrybacks\" to two years. Biden was vice president at the time the provision kicked in.\n\"Now business owners could request full refunds of taxes paid in the prior four years, and 50 percent of those from the year before that,\" the Times wrote.\nTrump took advantage of this change to wipe out the federal income taxes he paid from 2005 through 2007 with the tax refund, which he claimed and received starting in 2010, according to the Times. The refund is the subject of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.\nWhat does that have to do with depreciation and tax credits?\nWithout access to Trump\u2019s tax returns and financial records, it\u2019s difficult to know what \"privileges\" Trump was talking about. The Trump campaign did not respond when PolitiFact asked if there were other tax bills or privileges linked to Biden that Trump was referencing.\nBut tax experts said Trump\u2019s mention of the historic preservation tax credit he received for his hotel in Washington appears to jumble the details between the tax refund he got and other tax deductions or credits he may have taken to reduce his tax liability over the years.\n\"One could view the statement (from Trump) as simply confused and getting the details badly wrong,\" said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University School of Law.\nThe Obama carrybacks rule and Trump\u2019s tax refund\nTrump\u2019s debate-night claim has to do with the provision passed under Obama that allowed losses from businesses to be used to recoup taxes paid in the previous five years. The provision was part of the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009.\n\"A business can only carryback or carryforward certain amounts, and that bill removed some of those restrictions temporarily for 2008 and 2009,\" said Joseph Bishop-Henchman, the vice president of tax policy and litigation at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.\n\"It\u2019s an efficient, relatively hidden way to help certain rich people,\" added Edward McCaffery, a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California, who noted in an op-ed that a similar provision was included in the coronavirus relief bill from March.\nJoe Biden speaks at a panel on the economy in Washington\u00a0on Nov. 5, 2009, one day before the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 was signed into law. (AP)\nIn Trump\u2019s case, the change let him request the tax refund that is now being scrutinized by the IRS and a congressional tax committee. If the IRS decides the refund was illegitimate, the Times reported Trump could owe the government more than $100 million.\nThe audit dispute over Trump\u2019s tax refund may center, according to the Times, on Trump\u2019s declaration in his 2009 tax return of more than $700 million in business losses. The Times said the materials it obtained did not show which business or businesses created those losses.\nThe carryback rule would have allowed losses incurred for any reason to be applied to income up to five years in the past, McCaffery said, including losses from depreciation, or the reduction in the value of property or an asset over time.\nBut it\u2019s unlikely that all Trump\u2019s losses are from depreciation, experts told PolitiFact. The Times reported that Trump\u2019s records show that his casinos, golf courses and other interests lose real money, and that \"he has lost chunks of his fortune even before depreciation is figured in.\"\n\"We'd have to know precisely where the \u2018excess losses\u2019 that he had circa 2009 came from,\" McCaffery said. \"The fact that this is what the IRS is auditing strongly suggests it\u2019s not simply depreciation, which would be based on easily audited facts.\"\n\"There\u2019s a lot more to what he\u2019s done than just using depreciation and tax credits,\" added Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\nOther tax maneuvers documented by the Times included questionable write-offs for business expenses and a charitable tax deduction. But the $700 million in losses appears to correspond with Trump\u2019s decision to part ways with his casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., the Times reported.\nWhat did Biden have to do with depreciation, tax credits?\nThere\u2019s no obvious connection between the 2009 bill, which doesn\u2019t mention depreciation, and other depreciation deductions or tax credits Trump may have applied. Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said the change to carryback rules was not a tax credit.\nTrump\u2019s reference to his hotel in Washington, D.C., further muddles the facts.\nThe exterior of the Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 26, 2016. (AP)\nA 2015 report by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., found that the Trump Organization got $40 million in the form of a historic preservation tax credit for renovating the Old Post Office into a hotel, which the Times said he has used to reduce his tax liability in more recent years.\nBut that type of credit has been on the books since 1976. \"This didn\u2019t have to do with any policy change on the part of the Obama administration or Congress,\" Watson said.\nLaws enacted under Obama did create or extend several tax credits. Bishop-Henchman noted that Obama\u2019s economic recovery packages extended provisions allowing businesses to deduct 50% of the cost of certain properties up front, rather than write all costs off over time.\nAs a U.S. senator representing Delaware, Biden also voted yes on a pair of bipartisan tax laws in 1981 and 1986 that \"overhauled the depreciation system,\" Watson said, while also noting that \"depreciation existed in a slightly different form\" before 1981.\n\"We don\u2019t know how those particular changes impacted Trump\u2019s specific tax situation,\" Watson added. \"Depreciation changes in the code are generally changes in timing of when expenses associated with an investment are deducted, so they do not impact total tax paid in the long run.\"\nRegardless, Biden was just one senator.\n\"It\u2019s always peculiar when Trump is blaming Biden for legislation that happened to be enacted when Biden was in office as a senator or the vice president,\" Rosenthal said, noting that there are many more people involved with tax legislation.","cleaned_claim":"Joe Biden passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits.

Most of the money comes from school-affiliated foundations, endorsements, broadcast contracts and the like. If we only consider the direct taxpayer subsidy to salaries, coaches are the highest-paid public employees in at most 34 states -- and likely less.\nSo we rate Moran\u2019s statement Mostly True.","full_article":"U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, is ending his 24-year congressional career with hopes of reforming big-time college sports.\nMoran, who will retire Jan. 3, recently introduced legislation that would create a congressional commission to look into policies of the NCAA after myriad scandals involving misconduct by coaches and athletes, academic fraud and under-the-table payments.\nThe resolution calls for the panel to make recommendations to improve \"the interaction of athletics and academics\" on campuses. That includes examining the graduation rates of student athletes, rules restricting athletes\u2019 abilities to earn money, and the wherewithal of universities to finance broad athletic programs.\n\"We have a system now where in 40 states, the highest-paid public employee is the state university\u2019s head football or basketball coach, and yet only 20 schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision have athletic departments with revenue exceeding expenses,\" Moran said in a Facebook post.\nToday, we\u2019ll take a look at the claim that coaches top the payroll in 40 states. We\u2019ll come back soon with a Truth-O-Meter on Moran\u2019s statement that only 20 big-sport universities have athletic departments that make a profit.\nMoran\u2019s spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, sent us an email with three articles on coaches\u2019 salaries.\nOne, an op-ed in U.S. News and World Report, merely repeated the 40-state statistic as fact. The other two are graphics created by USA Today and Deadspin, a sports website. USA Today compiled salary information for head football and basketball coaches at major Division I schools.\nDeadspin\u2019s graphic was published in 2013 and uses data from the 2011-12 school year. Reporter Reuben Fischer-Baum considered the public employee pay information for each state and media reports on coaches\u2019 salaries. He found that 40 of the states had coaches at the pinnacle of the pay pyramid among public employees -- 27 were football coaches and 13 were basketball coaches.\nWe ran our own check and also found that coaches, when all of their annually guaranteed compensation is totaled, are the highest-paid public workers in 40 states -- often by a longshot. We compared the 2014 football and basketball head coaches\u2019 salaries listed in USA Today -- showing 107 of them are making at least $1 million a year -- with either salary data bases or the most current news report we could find on each state\u2019s payroll.\nBut there\u2019s a caveat to these raw figures. Many states don\u2019t list coaches as their top earners, even though the coaches\u2019 guaranteed pay may be many times higher than the next-highest paid public employee. That\u2019s because, as a general rule, only a small portion of coaches\u2019 earnings comes from taxpayers or a university\u2019s general fund. The lion\u2019s share comes from money raised by school-affiliated athletic foundations, personal appearance fees, product endorsements, broadcasts and cuts of team revenues. In addition, most coaches are eligible for sizeable bonuses based on their team\u2019s performance.\nFor example, although Virginia Tech football coach Frank Beamer\u2019s $2.6 million base salary outstrips anyone on the state payroll, he was not included in a list of top-paid public workers published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch in September. The reason: Beamer receives no state money and is not in the state salary database of public employees.\nVirginia\u2019s highest-paid state employee, according to the database, is Ronald Schmitz, chief investment officer of the Virginia Retirement System. He made $786,596 in salary and bonuses during the budget year than ended on June 30. Two years ago, George Mason University basketball coach Paul Hewitt topped the salary list, receiving state pay of $744,750.\nAs for some other high-profile coaches in the state during the last budget year::\nUniversity of Virginia football coach Mike London was paid $330,750 by the state. But his total salary, according to USA Today, was $2.3 million plus a possible $700,000 in bonuses.\nVA basketball coach Tony Bennett\u2019s guaranteed salary was $1.8 million -- $300,000 of which came from state coffers.\nVirginia Commonwealth University basketball coach Shaka Smart was paid $1.2 million -- $400,000 of which came from the state.\nWe should note that there are other state employees, often hospital physicians, who whose total pay packages are also supplemented by outside earnings.\nIdentifying the top earner in each state is tricky because of inconsistent and incomplete data. Moran and Deadspin, using guaranteed compensation packages to coaches, found 40 states whose highest-paid public employee ran a football or basketball team. The number drops to at most 34, we determined, if only direct state compensation to the coach is considered.

There is no connection between lockdowns and vaccine administration \u2014 in either country.\nIn both the U.K. and the U.S., regulators granted emergency use authorization to manufacturers such as Pfizer after their COVID-19 vaccines were proven in trials to be safe and effective. The manufacturers will continue monitoring participants in their final clinical trials, as the tweet says.\n\"Each of the companies wants to get full licensing,\" Grabenstein said, adding that they are \"well on their way\" toward doing so. \"The government wants them to earn their license.\"\nHowever, the emergency use authorizations that greenlighted the vaccines don\u2019t make the U.S. and U.K. \"unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends,\" experts agreed.\nEmergency use authorizations in the U.S.\nIn the U.S., stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are handed down at the state and local levels, while the emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration building in Silver Spring, Md., on Dec. 10, 2020. (AP)\nThe emergency approval has \"nothing\" to do with lockdowns, said Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California, Irvine.\nInstead, emergency use authorizations are temporary licenses granted while manufacturers collect more data and apply for full licenses, Noymer said. The FDA can grant them if the health and human services secretary has declared that a public health emergency justifies it.\nAlex Azar, the secretary under the Trump administration, made such a declaration Feb. 4, 2020.\nIn a statement to PolitiFact, the FDA said that unless they are revoked, the emergency use authorizations will remain in effect until the public health emergency declaration is lifted.\n\"The vaccines can be used under an emergency use authorization as long as there is a declared emergency,\" said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University. \"But a declared emergency does not require that there be \u2018lockdowns.\u2019 There can still be a declared emergency and vaccination without \u2018lockdowns.\u2019\"\nIn 2009, for example, the FDA granted several emergency use authorizations related to the swine flu, but the country never locked down.\nEmergency use authorizations in the U.K.\nIn the U.K., regulators at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency granted emergency approval to vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford University.\nSuch temporary licenses are allowed under British law during a public health emergency and while the full licensing process runs its course. In 2020, the law was amended to make them \"as similar to a usual marketing authorization as possible,\" an MHRA spokesperson said.\nThe COVID-19 restrictions constituting a lockdown, however, were voted on by Parliament. As in the U.S., lockdowns have no bearing on those emergency approvals, experts said.\n\"I am 99.9999% certain that emergency use does not equal a period of lockdown, said John Edmunds, professor of epidemiology and population health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, adding that the concept of emergency use has been around for years.\nIt wouldn\u2019t make sense for any government to \"bind its hands\" by tying lockdowns to the ability to continue administering vaccines, Grabenstein added.\nThe MHRA\u2019s conditions for authorizing the COVID-19 vaccines say the approvals \"will be valid until expressly withdrawn by MHRA or upon issue of a full market authorisation by the MHRA.\"\nGiven that language and other language on the MHRA\u2019s website, the duration of the temporary license appears to be within the MHRA\u2019s discretion, said Christopher Newdick, a professor of medical law and contract law at the University of Reading.\n\"It is not tied to the duration of the emergency lockdown described by the COVID regulations,\" Newdick said. \"So the licensing status of the vaccines is subject to a different range of considerations to do with safety and efficacy and a different timescale.\"","cleaned_claim":"They\u2019re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends because the emergency ends with it.","ambiguity_score":0.575288415,"paraphrases":[["They won't be able to give out vaccines if the lockdown is lifted, because the emergency status would be lifted as well.",0.3439649045],["If the lockdown ends, they will no longer be able to administer vaccines as the emergency will also end.",0.0315938033],["If the lockdown ends, they will no longer be able to administer vaccines, as the emergency situation will have ended.",0.0900456086],["They will not be able to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends, because the emergency status that allows them to do so will also end.",0.0520011261],["They will not be able to give out vaccines if the lockdown is lifted, as the emergency status will also be lifted at that time.",0.575288415]]}

Wisconsin is one of just a handful of states that ban election workers from starting to process these ballots until then.\n\"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee,\" LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, said Jan. 10, 2021, on WKOW-TV\u2019s Capitol City Sunday. \"It just takes them that long to load in those absentee ballots. So we need to make sure there\u2019s a process in place going forward so that reporting is timely.\"\nLeMahieu added that there was not \"widespread\" voter fraud in the 2020 election.\nThe state senator is precisely right about why Milwaukee ballots were reported in the early morning hours of Nov. 4, as the Wisconsin tally neared its conclusion. (Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes, one of five he flipped from Trump).\nLet\u2019s review what we know.\nHere we go again\nThe \"ballot dump\" claim has been one of the most widespread since the November election.\nA conservative website trumpeted it as \"Voter Fraud in Wisconsin.\" Widely shared Facebook posts claimed there was a \"ballot dump\" or \"found\" votes. Trump himself asserted that his lead in key states \"started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted\" and that \"Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly.\"\nThis line of thinking also appeared in numerous lawsuits and one nonsensical claim that statistics show the probability of Trump losing in Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania \"given President Trump\u2019s early lead ... is less than one in a quadrillion\" in each state.\nThose claims led to unanimous debunking from an array of fact-checking organizations. All are built on a fundamental misunderstanding of the vote-counting process.\nWisconsin, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states that don\u2019t allow absentee votes to be counted before Election Day. So the unprecedented volume of absentee ballots spurred by the pandemic created a bottleneck in the largest cities.\nThat brings us to a simple logical chain that explains the late Democratic votes in Milwaukee (and Atlanta and Detroit and Philadelphia).\nMilwaukee, like most large cities, is a longtime Democratic stronghold. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the city of Milwaukee 77% to 18%.\n\n\nWe knew well before the election that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to vote absentee. Polling showed 81% of the people planning to vote absentee in Wisconsin supported Biden.\n\n\nWe knew it was going to take a long time to count the absentee ballots, leading them to be reported later.\nThat counting time is why LeMahieu said he wants to change the law to allow workers to start on absentee ballots before Election Day.\n\"We need clear laws that are easy to follow, and we must instill confidence in the electorate that the results are accurate and free of fraud,\" LeMahieu said told PolitiFact Wisconsin. \"With the proper safeguards in places to ensure transparency, allowing the ballot count to begin early should accomplish both of those goals.\"","cleaned_claim":"It takes quite a while on Election Day to load those ballots, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.","ambiguity_score":0.9388562441,"paraphrases":[["It takes quite a while to load all the ballots on Election Day, which is why we have the 1 a.m. or 3 a.m. ballot dumping in Milwaukee.",0.2074165344],["It takes a long time to load ballots on Election Day, which is why there is often a ballot dump at 1 or 3 a.m. in Milwaukee.",0.0442482382],["It takes a long time to process all the ballots on Election Day, which is why there is often a delay in counting the votes in Milwaukee.",0.9388562441],["It takes a long time to process all the ballots on Election Day, which is why there is often a delay in results coming in from Milwaukee.",0.8435710669],["The process of loading ballots takes a long time, which is why Milwaukee has a ballot dumping process at 1 or 3 in the morning.",0.0304049719]]}

But gun sales between individuals not in the business - say, neighbors or hobbyists - are exempt.\nPresident Donald Trump has recently said he supports stronger background checks, but has not specified what changes he favors.\nVan Cleave told us his 3% statistic comes from a 2016 survey of 24,848 state and federal prisoners by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. The bureau reported its findings in January 2019.\nOf the inmates, 21% said they used or possessed a firearm while committing the crime that put them in prison, or about 5,200 of the sample, according to our calculation (the study did not break down its percentages into numbers of inmates). Of the prisoners\u00a0who used or possessed a gun during the crime:\n\u202243%, or about 2,240, said they got the firearm \"off the street or underground market.\"\n\u202225% - about 1,300 - said they bought or rented the gun from a relative or friend, or got it as a gift.\n\u20226% - about 310 - said they stole the gun.\n\u202210% - about 520 - said they bought the weapon at a retail outlet: a gun store, pawn shop, flea market or gun show. The rest got their guns by other means.\nNow, let\u2019s focus on the 10% who bought their guns from a retailer. They\u2019re important because the researchers identify them as the prisoners who were likely to have taken criminal background checks before they got their guns.\nOf that group of about 520 retail buyers, around 360 - or 69% - said they bought the gun using their own name. And about 350 of the retail buyers - or 67% - said they underwent a background check using their real name.

But there is no evidence Baldwin took active steps to cover up the matter, and a Senate committee determined that Baldwin had not engaged in a cover up.\nFor a statement that contains elements of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.","full_article":"On the campaign trail and in radio talk show interviews, Leah Vukmir has attacked U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin for months over the scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs medical center in Tomah, Wis., where veterans were over prescribed opioid painkillers.\nBut as the Nov. 6, 2018, election draws nearer, the Republican challenger\u2019s attacks on the Democratic incumbent are reaching a crescendo.\nVukmir hammered Baldwin again over the Tomah VA scandal on TV public affairs programs that aired Sept. 23, 2018 in Green Bay and in Madison. They were something of a prelude to a TV attack ad on the scandal that Vukmir aired three days later.\nSo, let\u2019s take a look at one of the attacks.\nVukmir was asked on \"Capital City Sunday\" on WKOW-TV in Madison how she would have handled the Tomah VA matter differently.\nShe responded by claiming that Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation \"to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids\" at the Tomah VA, \"later a veteran died\" and Baldwin \"covered it up.\"\nLet\u2019s break down the three-part attack, starting with a quick review about what we know about Tomah.\nThe scandal\nProblems at the Tomah VA first made news in January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. Doctors were handing out so many narcotic painkillers that some veterans had taken to calling the place \"Candy Land.\"\nThe attacks on Baldwin began in early 2017 from a super PAC largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. The group claimed in a radio ad that Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about \"overmedicated veterans,\" she made \"deadly mistakes\" and \"three veterans died.\"\nWe rated that False, based on how and when the deaths occurred and the \"deadly mistakes\" part of the claim.\nNow to Vukmir\u2019s claim, which doesn\u2019t go so far as to blame Baldwin for a death.\n1. Baldwin \u2018only one\u2019 to have a report\nThe first part of Vukmir\u2019s claim is that, among the Wisconsin members of the U.S. House and Senate, only Baldwin received a report \"outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids\" at the Tomah VA.\"\nThe report was done by the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Office of Inspector General following a 2\u00bd-year investigation of Tomah. Baldwin\u2019s office received it on Aug. 29, 2014.\nBaldwin did not make the report public, though she shared it with a constituent who had complained to her about what was happening at Tomah. The report was not given to any other member of Congress at the time.\nSo, Baldwin had been informed about the problems at the Tomah VA before they were exposed publicly. And she doesn\u2019t dispute that she was the first member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to get the report.\n2. \u2018Later a veteran died\u2019\nFormer Marine Jason Simcakoski died of a \"mixed use toxicity\" overdose at the Tomah VA while being treated by doctors there. Simcakoski had checked himself into the facility citing an addiction to painkillers and severe anxiety. He was prescribed 15 drugs, including anti-psychotics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants and the opioid painkiller tramadol.\nSimcakoski death, however, occurred Aug. 30, 2014 \u00a0\u2014 just one day after Baldwin received the VA inspector general\u2019s report about Tomah that Vukmir highlights.\nSo, it\u2019s misleading to say \"later a veteran died,\" given that Baldwin had not had time to act on the report.\n3. Baldwin \u2018covered it up\u2019\nThe third part of Vukmir\u2019s claim is that Baldwin \"covered it up\" \u00a0\u2014 a reference to the entire Tomah VA matter, not solely to Simcakoski\u2019s death. In the interview, Vukmir elaborates by saying Baldwin tried to \"fire one of her aides that brought the issue forward, offering the aide \"taxpayer hush money\" and hiring \"Hillary Clinton's attorneys\" to \"cover this up.\" Let\u2019s break down these sub-points.\nAn important point: It\u2019s clear Baldwin did not take steps publicly on the scandal until the Center for Investigative Reporting\u2019s expose \u00a0\u2014 months after she received the inspector general\u2019s report and Simcakoski\u2019s death. At the same time, there is no evidence that she took active steps to cover up the matter.\nFiring: Baldwin did fire an aide, but it\u2019s not entirely clear she did so because the aide \"brought the issue forward.\"\nIn January 2015, after the Center for Investigative Reporting\u2019s expose, Baldwin had called for the VA to investigate Tomah but remained under fire for inaction on the scandal. Baldwin then fired Marquette Baylor, her deputy state director, without explanation, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed. Whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee Ryan Honl told the newspaper he had talked with Baylor for two hours in late November 2014 about the Tomah VA and that she discouraged him from going public with his concerns, saying that doing so might get her and others fired. Baylor later said she had prepared three memos on the Tomah situation for Baldwin's review and forwarded them to her supervisors; she alleged they were either not delivered to Baldwin or were ignored by Baldwin.\n\u2018Hush money\u2019, Clinton lawyer: Baldwin did offer a severance payment to the fired aide and did hire a Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer. But this needs further explanation.\nAs part of the firing, Baldwin's office offered a severance package to Baylor that would have included a confidentiality agreement and a payment, the Journal Sentinel reported. Attorney Marc Elias, who was the top lawyer in Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was hired by Baldwin with campaign funds to review how her office handled the Tomah VA matter. He said the U.S. Senate's chief employment lawyer had helped put together the offer and described the confidentiality clause as routine.\nBaldwin later said the deal would have included a payment of about $17,000, which would have been from Senate funds. Baylor later rejected the offer and, according to Baldwin, sought more than four times that amount.\nElias said Baylor\u2019s handling of the Tomah VA matter was only one reason she was fired.\n\u2018Cover up\u2019: In addition to not releasing the inspector general report, Baldwin was slow to address the Tomah VA matter publicly. But ethics complaints filed against her alleging a cover up were found to have no merit.\nBaldwin avoided questions about the matter for weeks after the Center for Investigative Reporting\u2019s expose; and it took attorney Elias nearly a month to confirm Baylor\u2019s firing.\nAfter being fired, Baylor filed an ethics complaint accusing Baldwin of engaging in a political cover up by firing her for her alleged role in the mishandling of a whistleblower complaint. The complaint asked the U.S. Senate Ethics Select Committee to investigate Baldwin. The committee dismissed Baylor\u2019s complaint and two similar complaints filed by groups, saying they lacked merit.","cleaned_claim":"Tammy Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids at the Tomah VA, later a veteran died and Baldwin covered it up.","ambiguity_score":0.8927551508,"paraphrases":[["Tammy Baldwin was the only member of the Wisconsin congressional delegation to have a report outlining that a doctor was overprescribing opioids at the Tomah VA.

The National Rifle Association endorsed Trump, and \"in return\" Trump has adopted various anti-gun control positions, she said.\n\"He\u2019s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms,\" Clinton said. \"How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?\"\nWe wondered if Trump really has said he\u2019d put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list.\nThroughout the election, he has advocated for getting rid of gun-free zones at schools and military bases, arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations. And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office.\n\"I will get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases, he said at a Jan. 7 rally in Vermont. \"On my first day, it gets signed, okay, my first day. There\u2019s no more gun-free zones.\"\nThe Outdoor\u00a0Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later.\n\"I\u2019m going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases and I\u2019m also going to do it in schools,\" he said, adding that he would try to \"work with the states\" or \"perhaps override the states if I have to.\"\nThe topic came up again in May, when Trump accepted the NRA\u2019s endorsement. In the days that followed, he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus.\nIn his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement, he said, \"We're getting rid of gun-free zones, okay. I can tell you that. We're getting rid of them.\"\nOn May 21, Trump tweeted: \"Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!\"\nHe then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day, May 22: He doesn\u2019t advocate for guns in the classroom, but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom.\n\"I don\u2019t want to have guns in classrooms,\" he said. \"Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly. Because teachers are, you know. Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable. You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what\u2019s going on. But I\u2019m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\"\nWe looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May, but we were unable to find further clarification about his position. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment.\nOne final note: It\u2019s highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office. Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn. Meanwhile, states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed, as well.","cleaned_claim":"Donald Trump even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms.","ambiguity_score":0.1750791073,"paraphrases":[["Donald Trump said that he would require every school in America to allow people to carry guns into classrooms on his very first day in office.",0.0575985983],["Donald Trump said on his first day in office that every school in America would have to allow people to carry guns in classrooms.",0.1750791073],["Donald Trump said that he would require all schools in America to allow people to carry guns into classrooms on his first day in office.",0.0460688844],["Donald Trump has said that he would like every school in America to allow guns in classrooms.",0.038501028]]}

Meanwhile, critics of President Donald Trump responded that his administration had set the endgame in motion by striking a deal with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces by this year.\nSeveral posts highlighted the role of Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, such as one on Instagram that featured a photograph along with this caption: \"Guy next to @mikepompeo here in November of 2020 is the guy the Trump administration helped get out of jail in 2018 and who is now the 'president' of Afghanistan.\"\nDid the Trump administration really help a top Taliban figure get out of jail? Basically yes, although it's too early to say he whether he will\u00a0become leader of the Taliban\u2019s government in Kabul.\nThe man pictured meeting with Pompeo in 2020 is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He was a founder of the Taliban, which led a repressive regime that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and provided sanctuary to al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.\nIn 2001, when the Taliban\u2019s control of Afghanistan was weakening under pressure from a U.S.-backed offensive, Baradar tried to persuade leaders of his group to surrender. Taliban leaders rebuffed his suggestion.\nIn 2010, Baradar was captured by the United States and was imprisoned in Pakistan until 2018. During that time, however, officials inside and outside Afghanistan considered him one of the few Taliban leaders who they might be able to negotiate with.\nIn 2018, as negotiations to end the Afghanistan war were taking shape, the Trump administration urged Pakistan to release Baradar. He would become the head of the Taliban\u2019s political office in Doha, Qatar, from which he would participate in the negotiations.\nThe United States\u2019 special envoy for the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, confirmed the U.S. role in releasing Baradar in remarks at the U.S. Institute of Peace on Feb. 8, 2019.\nHis release \"was my request,\" Khalilzad said at the Institute of Peace forum. The Pakistani government \"accommodated that,\" he said.\nPompeo and his department made no secret about negotiating with Baradar. Using his government account, Pompeo tweeted a photograph from one of their meetings on Sept. 12, 2020, and the State Department issued a press release on the meeting, saying \"Secretary Pompeo urged the Taliban to seize this opportunity to forge a political settlement\u202fand reach a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire.\" (The photograph in the Instagram post appears to be of a different session between the two men, on Nov. 21, 2020.)\nThe talks produced an agreement for the U.S. to withdraw its troops by May 1, 2021. Biden largely stuck to the Trump-negotiated agreement, but delayed the deadline until Sept. 11, 2021. U.S. troops began to depart in May.\nThe one exaggeration in the Instagram post is that Baradar is \"\u2018president' of Afghanistan.\"\nWhile the Wall Street Journal reported that Baradar \"is the highest-ranking leader of the movement to appear in public since it took back control of Afghanistan,\" the newspaper added that \"the Taliban haven\u2019t said who will lead their movement, or how their government will operate.\"\nThe Washington Post referred to him as the Taliban\u2019s \"de facto leader.\"\nNews reports suggest that there\u2019s at least one figure above Baradar in the Taliban\u2019s organizational chart: Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has been referred to as the group\u2019s \"supreme leader.\" As of Aug. 17, Akhundzada had not yet emerged in public, Axios reported.\n\"The Taliban have not yet said who will be leading their new government, much less what the titles will be,\" said Laurel Miller, director of the Asia Program at the International Crisis Group, though she added that \"it would not be surprising for Baradar to take up a senior position.\"","cleaned_claim":"The man next to Mike Pompeo in a November 2020 photo is the guy the Trump administration helped get out of jail in 2018 and who is now the 'president' of Afghanistan.","ambiguity_score":0.017538134,"paraphrases":[["The man next to Mike Pompeo in a photo from November 2020 is the guy who the Trump administration helped get out of jail in 2018.

We rate Trump\u2019s statement Mostly False.","full_article":"An Iraq War veteran asked Donald Trump at NBC\u2019s Commander-in-Chief Forum how the Republican nominee would support veterans, beyond words.\nTrump referred the speaker to his website, saying one of the big problems veterans face is wait times to see doctors. He said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been dismissive of the crisis.\n\"And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated,\" Trump said. \"She did say that.\"\nHost Matt Lauer cut in, saying, \"No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\"\nTrump doubled down: \"Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.\nWe wondered if in fact Clinton had used those words to downplay reports about veterans waiting for months to get medical care.\nTrump\u2019s campaign issued a news release quoting Clinton at a November 2015 event, where she said, \"I think Secretary (Robert A.) McDonald is doing a great job, but there is a lot more that needs to be done.\"\nThe 16-second clip about McDonald, who took over the job in July 2014 after Eric Shinseki\u2019s resignation, doesn\u2019t provide much context of what she said before that quote. The Washington Post reported that Shinseki, former secretary, resigned May 2014 after reports that the VA hospital system \"conspired to hide months-long wait times that veterans faced when seeking care.\"\nThe event followed multiple media reports on extended wait times veterans face to get medical treatment, including reports of veterans dying waiting for care.\nTrump\u2019s campaign after the forum also pointed to a Wall Street Journal article on criticism Clinton received after saying \"It\u2019s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\" on MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show, regarding problems at the Veterans Affairs Department.\nIn that interview, Maddow asked Clinton about talks of privatizing the VA and if she had ideas on how to fix the program.\n\"You know, I don\u2019t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment,\" Clinton said in the Oct. 23, 2015, interview. \"Now, nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have.\"\nMaddow interjects: \"But in part because there has been real scandal.\"\n\"There has been. But it\u2019s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\" Clinton responded. \"Now, I do think that some of the reforms that were adopted last year should be given a chance to work. If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA.\"\nClinton went on to say the problem went \"deeper\" than access to health care and also included a backlog of disability determinations.\n\"There\u2019s something not working within the bureaucracy,\" she said.\nClinton spoke before Trump at the NBC forum and said she was \"outraged\" by the stories about the V.A. and that she has been \"very clear\" about the necessity to move the department into the 21st century.\nClinton has called for addressing the VA\u2019s problems at multiple town halls and campaign events.\nAt a June 2015 roundtable in Nevada, she said transforming the VA across the country should be a priority and \"what happened in Phoenix and elsewhere is absolutely unacceptable, period,\" transcripts show.\nLater in November 2015, Clinton said at a town hall that the VA \"does a lot of good work\" but also \"has systemic problems.\"\n\"And those have been revealed, and it's been shameful that people have been mistreated.

Trump\u2019s tax avoidance as documented by the Times is exceptionally aggressive, experts said, and the losses he has used to reduce his income taxes are bigger and more persistent than what\u2019s typical.\nWe rate Hewitt\u2019s statement Mostly False.","full_article":"A recent New York Times report that President Donald Trump has incurred staggering business losses and paid little to no federal income taxes in many years drew a challenge from some of the president\u2019s allies in the media, who said the pattern is typical for wealthy people.\nTrump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, and no taxes at all in 10 of the 15 years before that, according to the Times, which obtained nearly two decades\u2019 worth of tax-return data for Trump and his businesses.\nThe report also detailed huge losses incurred by the business empire Trump has cited as proof of his acumen. Those losses, along with other tax write-offs and maneuvers \u2014 such as a $72.9 million tax refund that\u2019s being scrutinized by the Internal Revenue Service and a congressional tax committee \u2014 have enabled the president to avoid paying much in federal income taxes while sustaining his lavish lifestyle.\nIn a Sept. 27 briefing at the White House, Trump dismissed the report. The next morning, one of his media defenders suggested that the report is much ado about nothing.\n\"I had an accountant look at it last night,\" radio host Hugh Hewitt said on his show. \"It's what any wealthy person's tax history is, if you can believe it \u2014 which is good years and bad years, years of immense taxes and years of almost no taxes at all because you carry over losses.\"\nHow does Trump\u2019s tax history compare with other wealthy people? We asked eight tax experts if the low tax bills and aggressive tax avoidance documented by the Times are typical of the rich.\nWithout access to the tax returns for Trump and others, they said, it\u2019s hard to draw comparisons. Everyone pays taxes according to their own unique circumstances, and wealthy people can use a variety of legal maneuvers to reduce their tax bills.\nBut the experts generally agreed that at least two aspects of Trump\u2019s tax history as described in the Times report stand out compared with other wealthy people who may also try to legally reduce their tax bills: the severity of his losses and the extent of his tax avoidance.\n\"The Trump tax returns appear highly unusual compared to typical wealthy taxpayers,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a professor of economics at Reed College. \"His losses are more persistent, his tax avoidance is more aggressive, and there are signs of tax evasion. The audit itself is a big red flag, and many of the described deductions sound borderline at best.\"\n\"I can't think of anyone who was as aggressive as Trump over such a sustained period,\" added Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. He called Hewitt\u2019s claim \"ridiculous.\"\nHewitt did not respond to a request for comment.\nTrump has avoided taxes and overseen major business losses\nTrump has filed the annual financial disclosure forms required of executive branch employees, listing his income sources and assets. But citing a pending audit, he has refused to release his tax returns, breaking from a longstanding precedent for U.S. presidents.\nThe New York Times report provided the most in-depth look yet at Trump\u2019s finances.\nA lawyer for the Trump Organization, the umbrella company for the Trump family\u2019s business interests, told the Times most of the report\u2019s facts appeared to be inaccurate. The lawyer said Trump had paid millions of dollars in federal taxes, but didn\u2019t provide details or documentation.\nThe Times reported that Trump paid little to no federal income taxes in many years, largely because his businesses \u2014 including major properties like his Doral, Fla., resort \u2014 have often reported losses that he has used to wipe out income tax liabilities for his earnings from \"The Apprentice\" TV show, branding deals and investments.\n\"Trump is using large tax losses from some businesses to offset his active income from wages or other businesses,\" said Edward McCaffery, a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California.\nThe Times reported that the nearly $1 billion in losses Trump experienced in the early 1990s generated tax deductions he was able to use through 2005. After new income from \"The Apprentice\" brought his tax bills back into the millions, he went on a buying spree, purchasing new golf courses and other properties that have since incurred similar losses.\nWealthy businesspeople do at times experience volatility with their incomes, or bad years followed by good ones, experts said. Real estate investors often benefit from generous tax rules covering the deduction of depreciation expenses, as well, according to the Associated Press.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Trump\u2019s pattern of big business losses and low income taxes resemble \"any wealthy person's tax history,\" as Hewitt claimed.\n\"It's wildly atypical to have lost so much, so consistently, from businesses that he personally operates,\" said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University School of Law.\n\"Carryover losses and deductions for real estate are obviously legal,\" added Omri Marian, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. \"It is certainly surprising, however, for people who maintain themselves as billionaires to pay so little tax for so long.\"\nIn a separate report, the Times wrote that Trump\u2019s tax avoidance \"sets him apart from most other affluent Americans,\" many of whom take advantage of loopholes in the tax code.\nThe average federal income tax rate for the highest .001% of earners in 2017 was 24.1%, the IRS says. Over the past two decades, Trump \"has paid about $400 million less in combined federal income taxes than a very wealthy person who paid the average for that group each year,\" according to the Times.\nOther data show similar discrepancies. Georgetown Law\u2019s Brian Galle, an expert in taxation, pointed to data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that shows the top 1% of households paying more than $400,000 in federal income tax on average in recent years.\n\"A typical billionaire, contrary to popular belief, pays tens of millions of dollars in taxes each year,\" said Joseph Bishop-Henchman, vice president of tax policy and litigation at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. \"A billionaire consistently paying at or near zero is not common.\"\nQuestionable tax deductions\nThe Times report also details many conflicts of interest created by Trump\u2019s refusal to divest from his businesses as president, as well as the financial stress that looms as millions of dollars in loans Trump personally guaranteed come due.\nTrump is still fighting the IRS over the $72.9 million tax refund from 2010, which was triggered by major business losses and helped wipe out several years\u2019 worth of tax liabilities. If the IRS decides the refund was illegitimate, he could owe the government over $100 million.\nThe refund and other questionable tax deductions Trump has claimed are signs that Trump may have been more aggressive in avoiding taxes than other wealthy people, experts said, although they cautioned that more facts would be needed to show evidence of illegality.\nThe Times reported, for example, that the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, while working as an employee of the Trump Organization, appeared to have received \"consulting fees\" that were later claimed as business expenses, which reduced the family\u2019s tax bill.\nMore information is needed to confirm whether Ivanka Trump was the recipient of those fees and whether there was wrongdoing, Georgetown Law\u2019s Galle said. But such a move is unusual for a person who is involved in a company\u2019s operations as an executive.\n\"It is common to hire consultants,\" Galle said. \"It is not common to hire your child as a consultant and pay her seven figures when she doesn't provide any actual services in exchange.\"\nOther experts raised questions about different tax write-offs described by the Times, such as Trump\u2019s classification of a New York estate as an investment property, rather than a personal residence, which allowed him to claim a charitable tax deduction. The classification also allowed Trump to claim millions of dollars in property taxes as a business expense.\nThe Times said Trump has also classified personal spending as business expenses \u2014 for example, more than $70,000 he spent on hairstyling during \"The Apprentice.\" Trump\u2019s position on these expenses was \"more aggressive\" than many wealthy people, said Joseph Bankman, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School.\nCharitable deductions and deductions for business expenses are \"widely used without abuse,\" said Bishop-Henchman. They are governed by an increasing number of rules.\nBut McCaffery, the expert at USC, said that while the deductions Trump has claimed are somewhat standard, they seem to have been \"taken to lavish extremes\" by the president: \"An actor can deduct hairstyling costs. But $70,000?\"","cleaned_claim":"President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns show what any wealthy person's tax history is, if you can believe it \u2014 which is good years and bad years, years of immense taxes and years of almost no taxes at all because you carry over losses.","ambiguity_score":0.0963641256,"paraphrases":[["President Donald Trump's tax returns show that wealthy people have good years and bad years, with some years seeing very high taxes and others seeing almost no taxes at all due to carryover losses.",0.0349670947],["President Donald Trump's tax returns show that even wealthy people have good years and bad years, with some years seeing almost no taxes at all due to carryover losses.",0.0393312424],["President Donald Trump's tax returns reveal that wealthy people's tax histories are a mix of good and bad years, with some years seeing very high taxes and others seeing almost no taxes at all due to carried-over losses.",0.0655008256],["President Donald Trump's tax returns show that he, like any other wealthy person, has had both good and bad years financially, with some years seeing him paying very little in taxes and others seeing him paying a great deal.",0.0963641256],["President Trump's tax returns show that wealthy people have good years and bad years, with some years seeing almost no taxes due to carried-over losses.",0.035595648]]}

There are some caveats to the watch list, including past issues with who is included and why. The report also didn\u2019t distinguish how many individuals are making these applications, or how many people on the watch list potentially buy firearms at gun shows.\nBut experts have told us the report is both plausible and not altogether unsurprising, given how many guns Americans purchase. We rate Murphy\u2019s statement Mostly True.","full_article":"U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy joined other Democrats in demanding the House take up a bill that would keep people on the FBI\u2019s watch list from buying guns, saying far too many people on the list have been allowed to get firearms.\nMurphy tweeted a graphic on Dec. 8, 2015, claiming that \"91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted.\"\nHis tweet came after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns. In an unusual procedural move, Murphy and other Democrats signed a petition to bring the bill to the House floor, but it currently doesn\u2019t have the required 218 signatures for further action. The Senate earlier in December struck down a similar bill.\nWe were curious if Murphy -- who is also running in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016 --\u00a0was right to say that 91 percent of suspected terrorists looking to buy guns were able to get one. Our research showed that is accurate by the best available estimates, but there are some caveats about the watch list we should keep in mind.\nWatching the watch list\nThe FBI maintains what is informally known as the terrorist watch list through its Terrorist Screening Center, which maintains a consolidated file of \"those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity.\"\nAs you can imagine, some critics are uneasy about the government maintaining any sort of list designating people potential enemies of the state, but it\u2019s generally considered a valuable tool for national security. The Democrats\u2019 bill allows for cross-referencing the list while conducting a background check for a firearm purchase.\nThe actual size of the list and who is on it is not public information, but we have estimates: In 2011, an FBI fact sheet said there were 420,000 people on the list. Current estimates have put the list at around 700,000. Since the database pulls information from U.S. and global agencies, only a relative handful \u2014 about 8,400 in 2011 and likely around 10,000 now \u2014 are American citizens or legal residents.\nMurphy\u2019s stat comes from a March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which examined how many people applying for gun purchases were run through the FBI\u2019s instant background checks and also were on the watch list.\nBetween February 2004 (when the FBI started keeping tabs on people on the list trying to buy guns) and December 2014, there were 2,233 people on the list who applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed, including three applications to buy explosives. That\u2019s a bit more than 91 percent.\nExperts have told PolitiFact that the GAO report is plausible, and not really that remarkable, considering how many gun purchases Americans have made in the past decade.

Donna Howard of Austin said in her July 18, 2018 tweet: \"Here's the thing. In Tx, charters get 100% state $\/pupil funding while district schools (95% students) get about 1\/3 funding from state w\/ rest coming from local prop taxes (which is why those taxes are so high). Districts getting less b\/c scarce $ going to charters.\"\nHoward was reacting to a national Associated Press news story on billionaires championing charter schools. Since 2006, the story says, philanthropists and their private foundations and charities--topped by the Walton Family Foundation, run by heirs to the Walmart fortune--gave almost half a billion dollars to 52 state-level charter support organizations to sustain, defend and expand the charter schools movement.\nTexas charter schools--public schools with charters run most often by private nonprofit entities--have boomed since the 1995 Legislature authorized them by law. Such schools must meet state-set academic accountability standards, but they\u2019re exempted from other laws affecting districts such as teacher certification and elementary school class-size limits.\nTo our inquiry, Bruce Marchand of the Texas Charter Schools Association called Howard\u2019s jam-packed claim factually \"squishy solid.\" The squishy part, Marchand said by email, \"is the implication that \u2018100% funded charters\u2019 have something to do with high property taxes and that districts get less money because that money is going to charters.\" Districts get less, Marchand said, because state dollars follow students based on where they\u2019re enrolled.\nLet\u2019s break down Howard\u2019s tweet by its factual elements.\nHoward said charter schools get all their funding from the state: Charter schools get nearly all their funding from state aid, Marchand agreed by phone, drawing 3 percent from grants and federal sources. That heavy state reliance is logical, Marchand and others said, because unlike districts, charter schools lack the authority to levy property taxes. According to a December 2017 Texas Education Agency document summarizing charter school funding, state aid to charter schools escalated from nearly $417 million for 2005-06 to about $2 billion in 2015-16.\nHoward said school districts serve 95 percent of students: Charter schools serve a growing handful of pupils--5.5 percent of Texas public school students in 2017, according to figures we fielded by email from the TEA\u2019s DeEtta Culbertson. That year, she said, 705 charter campuses enrolled 296,323 students--a doubling since 2011, according to an August 2018 agency presentation noted by Marchand. (The state caps the number of state-issued charters, but a charter-holder may open more than one school.) An implication: Districts in 2017 served 94.5 percent of public school students.\nHoward said districts get one-third of their aid from the state: Earlier this year, we reviewed Legislative Budget Board figures to conclude that in the 1980s, lawmakers voted for the state to cover 70 percent of the Foundation School Program, which is the state\u2019s primary way of funding schools. State aid, we found, ended up covering a little more than half of related state-local costs. State aid covered 44 percent of such costs in 2016; it\u2019s expected to cover 38 percent of such costs in 2019.\nThat\u2019s more than a third. When we sought Howard\u2019s factual backup, Jacob Cottingham in her office responded with materials including a January 2018 LBB chart delivering percentages like what we previously reported. Cottingham also emailed us a spreadsheet isolating state aid going to districts alone. According to the sheet, which Cottingham said he built based on LBB data, in 2016, more than $17.8 billion in state aid sent to districts accounted for 39 percent of state spending on public education. The sheet says that in 2019, more than $15.7 billion in state funds projected to go to districts will account for 32 percent of state school aid.\nHoward said the state\u2019s one-third share of what schools spend is why school property taxes are \"so high\": \u00a0To the contrary, we asked Howard, isn\u2019t it changes in the value of local property tax bases that drive how much state aid a district is entitled to receive?\nHoward replied with a statement noting that a district\u2019s per-pupil tax wealth is key to how much state aid flows. \"When students leave a district for a charter (or private school or drop out), the (district\u2019s) property wealth per student increases as there are fewer students, and the state's required minimum share to the district is decreased,\" Howard said.\nThe TEA\u2019s Culbertson separately responded by email: \"One of the primary drivers of the Texas school finance system is student attendance. If a student leaves a school district for any reason, including moving out of state, enrolling in another school district, public charter school, or private school (including home school), the original school district would no longer incur the costs of educating that student, and the original school district\u2019s total funding entitlement would be reduced.\"\nHoward said districts get less money because dollars go to charter schools: Cottingham told us Howard reached that conclusion by reviewing changes in per-student state spending on charter schools and districts.\nCottingham emailed us an LBB chart showing Foundation School Program state aid per student enrolled in districts compared with charter schools from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2016 plus estimated and projected aid for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019. The chart shows charter schools consistently getting thousands of dollars more per student in \"average daily attendance:\"\nSOURCE: Chart, \"Foundation School Program State Aid and Average Daily Attendance for School Districts and Charter Schools, Fiscal Years 2010-19,\" Legislative Budget Board, 2018 (confirmed by email, R.J. DeSilva, communications officer, Legislative Budget Board, July 31, 2018)\nAccording to the chart, charter schools in 2016 fielded $8,956 in state aid per ADA and school districts on average drew $3,800--meaning charter schools got 136 percent of what districts drew. By our calculations, the chart shows charter schools getting 149 percent of what districts would have gotten in 2017 and 167 percent of what districts would get in 2018 and 190 percent of what districts would get in 2019.\nCottingham told us the fact that state aid to districts goes up or down based on the value of local tax bases helps explain why districts are projected to get increasingly less in state aid than charter schools. Charter schools, he said, can count by law on getting each year\u2019s full average adjusted state-aid allotment in contrast to districts whose allocations are affected by how much they\u2019re expected to reap in property taxes. By phone, Amanda Brownson of \u00a0the Texas Association of School Business Officials offered a similar analysis.\nAnother facet noted by Cottingham: The state ponies up the full per-student \"entitlement cost\" of each student--costing the state more than each per-student payment sent to districts. Of late, the August 2018 TEA presentation says, charter schools draw an adjusted state allotment of $6,540--equivalent, the agency says, to what a small district receives. Meantime, the presentation says, more than 95 percent of students enrolled in districts are in districts getting less than $6,540 in state allotments.\nWe also heard back from Greg Worthington, a University of Texas doctoral student. By email, Worthington said legislation revising the school finance system that passed into law in a summer 2017 special session would result in numerous districts losing chunks of per-student aid as charter schools draw more.\nAsked how funding of charter schools results in less money for districts, Worthington offered a detailed reply centered on reductions in aid to districts caused by students transferring to charter schools.\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise, Worthington indicated, in that the concept of school choice promulgated by the late economist Milton Friedman relies on schools competing for funding tied to enrollment. Friedman said government might be responsible for funding schools, Worthington wrote, but he maintained it isn\u2019t supposed to administer education. School choice policies embraced by many ruling Republicans \"ultimately work to replace the public school system with a market-based education system,\" Worthington said.","cleaned_claim":"Texas charter schools get 100% state $\/pupil funding while district schools 95% students get about 1\/3 funding from state w\/ rest coming from local prop taxes which is why those taxes are so high.

(Read more about\u00a0our partnership with Facebook.)\nThis is a misinterpretation of data. The Italian National Institute of Health didn\u2019t lower its COVID-19 death toll by 97% \u2014 it released a detailed analysis on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients who have died in the country.\u00a0A spokesperson with the agency called the claim \"completely wrong.\"\nThe Oct. 5 report detailed 130,468 COVID-19 deaths in the country up until that point.\nIn one section, the report analyzed the cases of 7,910 people who died from COVID-19 in hospitals and looked for the most common comorbidities, meaning they had two or more health conditions at the same time.\nThat analysis found that 2.9% of the deceased COVID-19 patients had no comorbidities, 11.4% had one, 18% had two, and 67.7% had three or more. The conditions included heart disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases.\nThis is where the distortion comes in. Of all the deaths, 97.1% had one or more conditions listed aside from COVID-19, while the other 2.9% had none.\nSome have used this information to falsely claim that the Italian health department was \"lowering\" its COVID-19 death toll by 97% because those people had been previously diagnosed with other illnesses.\nBut pre-existing conditions present a risk factor for people who contract COVID-19, and chronic diseases in the elderly population are common. The presence of another condition by itself isn\u2019t evidence that a person didn\u2019t die of COVID-19.\nThe Italian National Institute of Health addressed these rumors in an Oct. 25 news release.\nThe agency reiterated that the 2.9% figure, also reported in previous editions, refers to the percentage of patients who died after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and who had no other conditions diagnosed before infection.\n\"The joint ISTAT-ISS reports drawn up on the basis of death certificates show that COVID-19 is the directly responsible cause of death in 89% of deaths of people positive to the SARS-CoV-2 test,\" the agency said in the release. \"In view of the fact that chronic diseases represent a risk factor for death from COVID-19 and that these are very common in the general population, it is not surprising the high frequency of these conditions in the SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased population.\"\n\"This is completely wrong,\" Italian National Institute of Health spokesperson Mirella Taranto told PolitiFact via email.\nTaranto added that COVID-19 was the primary cause of death for the 130,468 people mentioned in the report. In those cases, \"even if a patient has previous illnesses,\" like hypertension, diabetes, or obesity, \"the virus is responsible for their death,\" she said.\nShe pointed to the number of excess deaths in Italy as further proof.\nThe same diseases were present in the population at similar levels both in 2019 and 2020, but according to Italy\u2019s National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), the country registered more than 100,000 excess deaths in 2020\u2014after the pandemic started.\nAn interactive map maintained by the Italian Department of Civil Protection shows that Italy\u2019s COVID-19 death toll currently stands around 132,500.","cleaned_claim":"Italy drastically reduced the country\u2019s official COV1D-19 death count by over 97%.

Congress expanded the legal boundaries of intelligence gathering and turned back several efforts aimed to reveal details of how spying touched the lives of ordinary Americans. The only caveat: It seems unlikely that any of the amendments he referenced would have led the intelligence agencies to report on their spying on America\u2019s allies.\nBolstering FISA in 2008 and 2012\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, has been around since 1978. It basically sets the ground rules for spying on foreign agents, especially when that spying touches American soil and might touch American citizens. It gives a special court the power to oversee that work. After the terrorist attacks of 2001, President George W. Bush pressed to give intelligence agencies additional money and authority to look at information that people might have thought was private, such as library records. That was the \"any tangible thing\" that Stewart referred to.\nBut library records were a tiny sliver of the data collection program created by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Electronic information, over the Internet and through telephone networks was gathered and stored in vast quantities.\nThe collection of that data became known in 2006, when the role of major companies such as Verizon and AT&T was revealed. That prompted a 2008 review of the FISA law, to basically retroactively approve the arrangement.\n\"The 2008 amendments appear to be designed to legalize warrantless wiretapping by the NSA that had been done illegally prior to the amendment,\" said Molly Bishop Shadel, an expert in foreign intelligence law at the University of Virginia School of Law. \"Congress expanded the scope of FISA even though it knew or should have known that the NSA had done something questionable.\"\nDuring the debate in 2008 the main point of contention was whether to grant retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies that apparently had given the government access to data that passed through their networks.\nWhile the changes in 2008 did set some limits on domestic surveillance, they gave intelligence agencies greater flexibility to use new technology to track the activities of foreign agents so long as they were outside American borders, even if their communications ran through American systems. The 2008 revisions were to last five years, which prompted further tinkering in 2012.\nBy 2012, several members of Congress offered amendments that would have compelled intelligence agencies to give Congress more details on their activities. One from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., would have urged the government to share key interpretations of law from the FISA court. Another from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., would have told the government to report the number of Americans whose personal records had been caught up in its surveillance nets and would have strengthened the rules against warrantless searches. A third from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., would have required a warrant for access to any U.S. communication, although it didn\u2019t speak directly to greater disclosure to Congress.\nThe Senate rejected all three amendments. Wyden\u2019s bill came the closest but failed 52-43.\nThe overall reauthorization of the wiretapping program passed 73 to 23.\nThe expanded reach of intelligence agencies continued and any amendment that Stewart referred to was turned back. (We reached out to The Daily Show for supporting details but did not hear back.)\nCongress \"definitely had a chance to pass amendments that would have given them more information,\" said Trevor Timm, a privacy activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nBut there is a caveat.\nTimm said none of the amendments would have changed American activities overseas.

Greg Abbott updated his reopening plan to add businesses such as hair salons and gyms, he recommended that at-risk populations \"remain at home if at all possible\" and avoid in-person gatherings, such as a church service, funeral or wedding.\n\"We strongly encourage at-risk populations to try to watch or participate remotely, remembering this very important point, and that is almost 75 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the state of Texas are a result of people contracting COVID-19 who are age 65 and older,\" Abbott said.\nTexas was among the first states to start reopening businesses and lifting restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, allowing retail stores and restaurants to open May 1 at 25 percent capacity.\nAbbott announced the latest set of reopenings Monday, expanding restaurant capacity to 50 percent and granting bars the ability to open at 25 percent capacity within the next couple weeks.\nThis comes as the state continues to see its number of infections and deaths rise and clusters form mostly in rural parts of the state where meatpacking plants are located. Hospitalizations, however, have decreased since mid-April.\nWith that in mind, we had to ask: Is Abbott right that almost 75% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are people older than 65?\nLooking at the numbers\nAbbott\u2019s spokesman John Wittman said Abbott\u2019s claim is based on figures from the Texas Department of Health Services, which publishes daily numbers on the state\u2019s COVID-19 testing and cases.\nThe data includes a breakdown of coronavirus deaths by age, race and gender, but only for those cases where the deaths have been investigated by the local and regional health departments. As of Wednesday, the majority, or 489, were still under investigation.\n\"The demographic data on cases and fatalities come from the case investigation forms submitted by local health departments and our regional offices,\" said DSHS spokesman Chris Van Deusen.\nThe purpose of the investigation is to confirm that the person had COVID-19 but also to collect other details about them and the circumstances around their death, Van Deusen said.\nWittman said the data showed that 75% of investigated deaths were people 65 and older when Abbott made this statement.\n\"It alternates almost daily, but it\u2019s generally around that range,\" Wittman said.\nAs of May 6, the day after the press conference, the death toll in Texas was 948. Fewer than half, or 433, had been investigated.\nOf those, about 71 percent were Texans 65 and older. It was still about 71 percent, or 345 out of 489 investigated cases, as of Wednesday. The age groups broke down like so:\nAges 10 to 19 years old: 2 deaths, or 0.4%\n\n\nAges 20-29: 10 deaths, or 2.04 %\n\n\nAges 30-39: 9 deaths, or 1.8%\n\n\nAges 40-49: 21 deaths, or 4.29%\n\n\nAges 50-59: 54 deaths, or 11.04%\n\n\nAges 60-64: 45 deaths, or 9.2%\n\n\nAges 65-69: 59 deaths, or 12.06%\n\n\nAges 70-74: 45 deaths, or 9.2%\n\n\nAges 75-79: 45 deaths, or 9.2%\n\n\nAges 80+: 196 deaths, or 40.08%\nAcross the United States, about 79% of coronavirus deaths have been people 65 years and older, according to the National Center for Health Statistics data submitted between the beginning of February to the beginning of May.\nLike Texas\u2019 statistics, the national numbers are also incomplete. The number of deaths represent only those entered between those dates and only include people with confirmed or presumed COVID-19.\n\"While 80% of deaths are electronically processed and coded by NCHS within minutes, most deaths from COVID-19 must be coded by a person, which takes an average of 7 days,\" the NCHS states on its website.\nThe data is also always somewhat behind because of the lag time between when a death occurred and when a death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes.

Additionally, McConnell said he supported bankruptcy as a novel option for states, particularly for those with pre-existing pension liabilities.\nTillis said he agreed with McConnell \"more or less.\" He agreed that Congress shouldn\u2019t pay for revenue losses that aren\u2019t related to the coronavirus outbreak. But Tillis never actually said he wanted states to go bankrupt. And he said he will consider federal aid for smaller governments on a case-by-case basis.\nCunningham\u2019s tweet exaggerates what McConnell said and misrepresents what Tilils has said about federal coronavirus aid.

We rate it Mostly False.","full_article":"Local and state governments are expected to have budget shortfalls as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAnd, according to the Democrat in North Carolina\u2019s U.S. Senate race, the Republican incumbent thinks struggling communities should go bankrupt.\nThat\u2019s what Cal Cunningham said about Sen. Thom Tillis.\n\"Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief. Today, Thom Tillis agreed,\" Cunningham tweeted April 24, linking to a Politico story.\nIs that true?\nThere\u2019s a lot of context being left out.\nYes, Tillis did say he is \"more or less aligned\" with what McConnell, the U.S. Senate majority leader, said about not giving more federal dollars to states that had pre-existing budget problems. McConnell proposed allowing them to file for bankruptcy, which states are not currently permitted to do.\nBut Cunningham exaggerated what we know about Tillis\u2019 position. Tillis\u2019 comments clearly show he doesn\u2019t want the federal government to pay for state debt that wasn\u2019t incurred during the coronavirus outbreak. What\u2019s less clear is whether he wants those states to go the bankruptcy route.\nWhat McConnell said\nSo what did McConnell say about bankruptcy? In a radio interview on April 22, McConnell said states with pre-existing problems might be better off declaring bankruptcy than by expecting additional funding from the federal government. But he didn\u2019t specifically say he \"wanted\" states to declare bankruptcy, only that he supports it as an option.\n\"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route. It saves some cities. And there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available,\" McConnell said. \"My guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.\"\nAs The Atlantic reported, McConnell expanded on his bankruptcy comments in another radio interview that day:\n\"We\u2019re not interested in solving their pension problems for them. We\u2019re not interested in rescuing them from bad decisions they've made in the past, we\u2019re not going to let them take advantage of this pandemic to solve a lot of problems that they created themselves (with) bad decisions in the past.\"\nWhat Tillis said\nThat brings us to Tillis and how closely he has \"agreed\" with McConnell.\nAudio of the April 24 town hall shows a constituent named Charles saying he has a question about the future: \"Will the Senate vote to bail out poorly-run states that were near bankrupt before COVID-19 hit?\"\nTillis wasn\u2019t asked about states in general. He was asked specifically about \"poorly-run states that were near bankrupt\" prior to the pandemic. Tillis said he doesn\u2019t think those states should be bailed out.\n\"Well, Charles, that's a great question and personally I don't think we should, and I don't think that we can,\" Tillis said.\nHe then said the $2 trillion economic stimulus gave him \"pause,\" but was worth it. Then he used North Carolina\u2019s state government as an example of good financial stewardship:\n\"I'm not so sure that taxpayer dollars for North Carolina should go to a state, a county, or a city that, like you said, was in poor economic shape before we ever had the virus. We need to take care of first responders. We need to take care of law enforcement. And we will do that. But I don't believe that I can support any measure that is effectively a bailout for poorly run state and local governments.\n\"We can look at things on a case-by-case basis where it's very clear that the damage is done because of the virus impact. But a broad-based bailout is not something I'd be prepared to support.\"\nThat\u2019s when Tillis brought up McConnell\u2019s comments.\n\"You probably heard Leader McConnell's comments about it, I'm more or less aligned with Leader McConnell on the issue,\" Tillis said, a few seconds later adding: \"I think we need to work on executing (plans already signed into law) and not really entertain a discussion of trillions more going into jurisdictions that really need to get their financial houses in order.\"\nCunningham spokeswoman Rachel Petri said Tillis\u2019s comments about McConnell show he\u2019s in lockstep with the Senate leader, who said \"I would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route.\"\nTillis elaborated on his position in an interview with Fox News radio's Guy Benson on April 29. Benson asked him about McConnell\u2019s comments that money should not cover pre-pandemic budget holes (without mentioning the bankruptcy idea).\nTillis said the Senate \"will go back and take a look at well-documented cases for the costs of the response, potentially the cause of some of the revenues in this year based on closures.\"\nWhen PolitiFact asked about Tillis\u2019 position on the bankruptcy option, Tillis campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo said:\n\"Sen. Tillis has never advocated for any state or municipality to go bankrupt as a result of COVID-19, has already delivered billions of dollars in relief to North Carolina, and has consistently said that he supports providing targeted assistance for communities that have been impacted by the virus.\"","cleaned_claim":"Mitch McConnell said he wanted states to go bankrupt instead of the federal government providing relief.

That means it\u2019s theoretically possible the company could earn up to $1.35 billion in investment incentives but not employ anyone, if it built the facility but never operated it.

Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people, with the potential for 13,000.\nWe also rated Half True a claim that Wisconsin\u2019s offer could amount to more than $1 million per job. That could occur If Foxconn invests $9 billion in the plant and equipment, but hires only 1,500 workers. But there is no evidence the company would invest that much and only employ 1,500 people.\nNow to Gronik\u2019s claim.\nThe incentive offer\nThe incentive package is worth up to $3 billion, but $150 million of that is sales tax exemptions -- in other words, Foxconn wouldn\u2019t have to pay up to $150 million in sales taxes on construction materials for the plant.\nThat leaves $2.85 billion -- the nearly $3 billion Gronik referred to. It comes in two parts.\n1. The state would pay Foxconn based on how much the company invests in the plant and equipment. The maximum payment is $1.35 billion, if Foxconn invests at least $9 billion.\nSo, the $1.35 billion is not tied directly to jobs at the Foxconn plant, though the investment would clearly employ construction people. It\u2019s theoretically possible, if unlikely, that Foxconn could receive the $1.35 billion, or some portion of it, if it builds the plant but then -- say, if market conditions change -- abandons it without employing anyone.\nIt\u2019s also possible the plant could be built to maximize automation, which would require fewer workers.\n2. The state would also pay Foxconn based on the size of its payroll at the plant. The maximum would be $1.5 billion, if payroll reaches $8.8 billion within a 15-year period, Wisconsin Budget Project director Jon Peacock told us. For example, the $1.5 billion could be earned if Foxconn employs 13,000 people who make at least $30,000 and have an average salary of about $54,000, he said.\nIn other words, the more people hired by Foxconn, the more the state would pay to the company.\nIn sum:\nThere is no flat guarantee from the state of nearly $3 billion.\nRoughly half of the incentives would be based on how much is invested in the manufacturing plant, and roughly half would be paid based on employment. In both cases, the incentives are paid, on a pay-as-you go basis, based on what the company does.\nA parting note: Walker's administration is negotiating a final contract with Foxconn. So, it\u2019s possible a minimum jobs requirement could be made part of the deal.","cleaned_claim":"Wisconsin is guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long and at what pay.","ambiguity_score":0.5285315514,"paraphrases":[["Wisconsin is guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not contractually guaranteeing how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long they will work, or how much they will be paid.",0.0118214507],["Wisconsin is giving Foxconn nearly $3 billion, but there is no guarantee from Foxconn about how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long, or at what pay.",0.0275239982],["Wisconsin is giving Foxconn almost $3 billion, but Foxconn is not promising how many full-time employees it will hire, for how long, or at what pay.",0.0674914345],["Wisconsin is guaranteeing Foxconn almost $3 billion.

Phil Scott\u2019s office reached out with additional information clarifying his statement as focusing on the Medicaid patient pool. This made the statement more accurate \u2014 we changed the ruling from mostly false to half true \u2014 but Scott still left out important context about overall costs associated with the OneCare program.\nGov. Phil Scott trumpeted the successes of Vermont\u2019s health care reform efforts in his budget address last month.\n\"There are compelling stories to be told, and accountable care is showing more potential than any other health care reform I can remember,\" he said of OneCare Vermont, the state\u2019s accountable care organization.\n\"In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million,\" Scott said.\nThat savings figure jumped out at us. Our research on OneCare has found mixed results \u2014 and\nan open admission from health care officials that the program has not yet created the savings they hope to achieve. Did we miss something?\nWe asked Scott\u2019s office for evidence and were referred to Ena Backus, director of health care reform for the state. She cited a Department of Vermont Health Access report on 2018 results for Medicaid patients.\nThe $7.7 million in savings came from a small portion of Vermont\u2019s nearly 200,000 Medicaid patients. About 42,000 of those Vermonters participate in OneCare, said Alicia Cooper, director of payment reform for the department. An even smaller portion of those patients see doctors who are paid a set fee each month, rather than payments for each procedure.\nAnd it\u2019s that subset of patients \u2014 those participating in OneCare whose doctors are paid a monthly fee \u2014 who cost the state $7.7 million less to care for than was originally expected, according to Backus.\n\"That point that was made [by Scott] demonstrates that there was a change in provider behavior that we can measure,\" Backus said.\nEthan Latour, a spokesperson for Scott, further clarified this point in an email to VTDigger. \"Those words, STATE and THROUGH THE ACO, explicitly describe the population,\" he wrote.\nThe problem? Scott referred in his speech to the \"amount of money spent on health care services.\"\nFirst off, his statement implies that there were savings in the entire health care system \u2014\u00a0 not just a small piece of it. Secondly, the $7.7 million wasn't returned to taxpayers. Under the new model, OneCare Vermont and hospitals keep the savings, as a reward for keeping patients healthy.\nOneCare actually spent more money than expected \u2014\u00a0about $1.5 million \u2014\u00a0on all medical care for state Medicaid patients in 2018, if you factor in the doctors who charged traditional fee per procedure rates.\nScott also didn\u2019t mention that Vermont taxpayers paid OneCare $11.7 million for administrative costs that year.\nOneCare collects money from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial insurance and then distributes it as a flat monthly payment for patient care. The administrative costs and incentives paid by the state cannot be entirely divorced from savings created by the program.\nIn addition, the governor cited savings in the Medicaid program but across the OneCare there were no net decreases in spending after administrative costs and incentives for providers.\nScott\u2019s assessment led him to urge the Legislature to grant OneCare $5.7 million in additional Medicaid monies during the state budget adjustment process -- on the condition the accountable care organization applies for nonprofit status or meets equivalent transparency standards.\nThe real problem, Scott said, is OneCare\u2019s ineffective public relations effort. In his budget speech, the governor invoked the state\u2019s head regulator, Green Mountain Care Board chair Kevin Mullin, who in November urged the organization to tell a better story.\n\"I understand the ACO hasn\u2019t done a great job explaining how they\u2019re improving people\u2019s health and reducing costs,\" Scott said. \"But there are compelling stories to be told.\"\nCooper, from the Department of Vermont Health Access, said Scott\u2019s $7.7 million assertion may be one of those stories. \"At Medicaid, we\u2018re encouraged by these early results,\" she said. \"That\u2019s enough to warrant continued testing of the model.\"","cleaned_claim":"In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO reduced the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million.","ambiguity_score":0.0555779748,"paraphrases":[["In 2018, the amount of money spent on healthcare services through the ACO was reduced by $7.7 million.",0.0174634829],["In 2018, the providers who were paid by the state through the ACO managed to reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million.",0.0146995727],["In 2018, the amount of money spent on healthcare services through ACOs was reduced by $7.7 million.",0.0555779748],["In 2018, the providers the state paid through the ACO were able to reduce healthcare costs by $7.7 million.",0.0118181864],["In 2018, the providers who were paid by the state through the ACO were able to reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare services by $7.7 million.",0.0189166255]]}

That document touted Clinton\u2019s efforts on stopping illegal immigration. Using similar words as what Gaetz described, it said that in 1992, \"Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again.\"\nGaetz accurately captured the party\u2019s sentiment in the mid 1990s. More recent platforms have favored a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\nWe rate this statement Mostly True.","full_article":"In an emotional congressional hearing on gun violence, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparked controversy when he brought up deaths by immigrants in the country illegally, drawing shouts from fathers whose children were shot to death in Parkland.\nGaetz said Feb. 6 that a proposed gun background check bill would not have stopped violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. However, he said that a \"wall, a barrier on the southern border may have.\"\nThe next day, CNN host Chris Cuomo asked Gaetz why he brought up immigrant-linked deaths during the gun violence hearing in an interview the next night. Gaetz offered a fiery rebuttal, misleadingly saying that the \"new left\" wants to be \"borderless with no ICE.\" ( In 2018, congressional Democratic leaders called for a restructuring of Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 which handles removals from inside the country \u2014 but not an end to immigration enforcement. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but many others talk of changing or limiting the agency.)\nAt one point, Gaetz argued that the Democrats used to call for cracking down on illegal immigration, too.\n\"In 1992, the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing,\" said Gaetz, of Fort Walton Beach.\nGaetz\u2019s claim about the party\u2019s platform was new to our ears, so we decided to fact-check it. We found that Gaetz had a point, but was off by one presidential cycle. The 1996 Democratic Party platform was unusually tough in raising alarm about illegal immigrants committing crimes, being deported and returning to the United States.\nWhat the Democratic Party platform said in the 1990s\nThe political parties write platforms in presidential election years to outline their positions on major political issues. They offer a collective vision to which the candidates are somewhat bound.\n\"Convention delegates, interest groups, party activists, and party officials fight very intensely over planks in the platform because they believe those words are important and define just what the party stands for,\" said University of Denver political science professor Seth Masket. \"They're not just to tell candidates what to run on; they're to tell party members just what kind of candidates they want to nominate in the first place.\nThe 1992 party platform said very little about immigration. The brief mention shows the Democrats using welcoming terms:\n\"Our nation of immigrants has been invigorated repeatedly as new people, ideas and ways of life have become part of the American tapestry. Democrats support immigration policies that promote fairness, non-discrimination and family reunification, and that reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel.\"\nGaetz\u2019s spokeswoman told us that he was referring to the 1996 party platform, which indeed offered a sharp turn. That platform took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration and praised efforts on border security by President Bill Clinton, who was running for his second term.\nPart of the platform read:\n\"Today's Democratic Party also believes we must remain a nation of laws. We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. For years before Bill Clinton became president, Washington talked tough but failed to act. In 1992, our borders might as well not have existed. The border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again. \u2026 Just since January of 1995, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported.\"\nThat language is similar to what Gaetz cited: the Democrats talked about immigrants in the country illegally committing crimes, being sent back to their home countries, and then returning to the United States.\nGaetz didn\u2019t mention this, but the platform also contained a pro-immigration message. It said, for example, \"we deplore those who blame immigrants for economic and social problems\" and \"deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination.\"\nAt the time, the Republican Party platform was more aggressive. It asserted that undocumented immigrants increase crime, that children of illegal immigrants should be blocked from gaining citizenship, and English should be the official U.S. language. It had a brief\u00a0nod about the United States as a nation of immigrants:\u00a0\"We welcome those who follow our laws and come to our land to seek a better life. New Americans strengthen our economy, enrich our culture, and defend the nation in war and in peace.\"\nBackdrop of immigration politics in 1996\nThe Democratic platform in 1996 was influenced by the changing immigration politics of the early to mid 1990s.\nThe number of unauthorized immigrants was rapidly rising, from 4.2 million in 1992 to 5.6 million in 1996 (a 33 percent increase). Public opinion polls indicated that two-thirds of Americans believed that immigration levels should be decreased.\nMajor constituencies of the Democratic Party, including unions and environmentalists, also advocated for reductions in immigration, said Rey Koslowski, a University at Albany political science professor.\nThe U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform chaired by Democrat Barbara Jordan recommended increasing Border Patrol officers, restricting the ability of undocumented immigrants to get public services and reducing legal immigration.\nThe more conservative approach was part of Clinton\u2019s broader effort to move the Democratic Party to the center. The \"New Democrat\" agenda included his 1996 overhaul of welfare (half of which was initially paid for by cutting all benefits to permanent resident aliens) as well as revisions to immigration law.\nThe Democratic Party, having spent a long time being battered as being soft on crime, made a strategic decision to embrace the illegal immigration control pieces of the legislation, said William Stock, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\nClinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act into law on Sept. 30, 1996 \u2014 just in time for the November presidential election. The 1996 law called for deporting immigrants who were once legally in the United States but now subject to deportation because of a criminal conviction.\nThese efforts in 1996 helped Clinton attract a large swath of voters, including industrial workers in the midwest (so-called Reagan Democrats), independents, environmentalists and Southern Democratic voters. \"And it worked,\" Koslowski said.\nBefore the election, the Republicans thought they would parlay their 1994 midterm sweep into a presidential victory, choosing San Diego, Calif., as the site of their national convention. Two years before, California voters passed a measure that prohibited illegal immigrants from using health care, public education and other services. (Courts later deemed Proposition 187 unconstitutional.)\nClinton won re-election and received 72 percent of the Latino vote.\nOver time, the Democratic Party\u2019s platform shifted to helping undocumented immigrants as immigration became more of a civil rights issue.\nThe 2016 platform made\u00a0a passing nod to border security, calling for a pathway to citizenship and stating that enforcement should focus on safety threats.\n\"President Trump and his aggressive immigration enforcement, unlike that seen in any modern president, has further polarized the issue and led many Democrats to resist the enforcement initiatives,\" said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis, School of Law.","cleaned_claim":"In 1992, the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing.","ambiguity_score":0.0225940403,"paraphrases":[["In 1992, the Democratic Party's platform included provisions saying that illegal aliens were coming into the country, committing felonies, and then being sent back across the border to do the same thing.",0.0176775549],["The 1992 Democratic Party platform contained provisions regarding illegal aliens committing felonies and being sent back across the border.",0.0122537529],["The Democratic Party in 1992 had a platform that said illegal aliens were coming into the country, committing felonies, and then being sent back across the border to do the same thing.",0.0225940403],["In 1992, the Democratic Party's platform included provisions stating that illegal aliens were coming into the country and committing felonies, but were being sent back across the border.",0.0166414268],["The 1992 Democratic Party platform included provisions stating that illegal aliens were coming into the country, committing felonies, and then being sent back across the border to do the same thing.",0.0164543632]]}
